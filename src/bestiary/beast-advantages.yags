            <para>
                An <e>Animal</e> is not capable of sapient thought in the
                same way that humans are. Their intelligence rating is used
                instead to represent animal cunning. They may have a high
                intelligence, but aren't capable of abstract thought.
            </para>

            <para>
                Animals with an intelligence of 3+ may be capable of using
                tools (e.g., crows or chimpanzees). Most herd animals will
                tend to have an intelligence of 1, predators about 2.

                A <e>Tiny</e> animal is smaller than Size 0. Their Size

                which are described in the <s>Bestiary</s> section on

            <para>
                A <e>Weak</e> creature is too small to have a physical
                strength comparable to humans, and so all strength rolls
                (including damage) are halved. Soak rolls against non-weak
                attacks are also halved. Generally, animals with
                a Size of 3 or less will be considered <e>Weak</e>.

                A <e>diseased</e> creature carries some form of pathogen
                that can infect another living creature. The nature of
                the disease may vary from creature to creature, but unless
                otherwise stated it is assumed that the creature is likely
                to be carrying some generic disease, rather than generating
                a specific type of disease themselves.

            <para>
                For any natural attack (normally bite or claw) that hits
                and causes one or more wounds, the target should make a
                <t>Health</t> check against a difficulty of 15 + 5 per
                level of wound. Failure means that they have contracted a

            <para>
                An undead creature is a walking corpse, animated through
                supernatural means. Undead do not need to eat, drink or
                breath. They are difficult to kill, since they do no have
                vital organs, and only take a wound or stun for every 10
                points of damage over their soak unless the damage comes
                from a Vehicle scale weapon. They often have abnormal
                health (seven), above average strength, and low will.

            <para>
                Undead are immune to both poison and disease. It may be

            <para>
                An incorporeal creature has no physical body, and hence no
                direct way to affect the physical world. They have no wound
                or stun levels, and no soak, since they cannot be harmed
                physically. An incorporeal may attack by draining the energy
                from people, causing fatigue levels. When attacking, it only
                requires to touch the individual - a parry is useless. Damage
                uses its will instead of strength, and the target uses
                their <health/> for soaking.

            <para>
                A blessed creature has been touched by the supernatural,
                and draws strength from some other realm. As such, it is
                able to heal damage dealt to it very quickly, making it
                almost immune to damage from normal sources. A blessed
                creature is either blessed by the light, or blessed by
                darkness. Both types of blessings behave the same, but
                creatures of the light are affected by weapons of
                darkness and vice versa.
            </para>

            <para>
                A blessed creature, on receiving either wounds or stuns,
                will immediately heal one level of both. This occurs
                after effects of the wound are accounted for. So a single
                blow which fatally wounds a creature could still kill
                it. If the creature survives however, it would then
                become critically wounded (regardless of how wound levels
                beyond fatal the creature was taken).
            </para>

            <para>
                At the end of the round, and each round thereafter, the
                creature will heal one wound and stun level, until it
                is fully healed.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some weapons may be blessed (either by light or darkness),
                and damage caused by these cannot be healed with this
                advantage. A light blessed creature cannot heal wounds
                from a darkness weapon, and vice versa.
