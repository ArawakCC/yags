        <description>
            <short>
                The most common form of undead.
            </short>

            <physical>
                <para>
                    Zombies are generally the unintelligent re-animated corpses
                    of the recently dead. They have flesh, often enough to still
                    be recognisable as the person they were in life, but they
                    are no longer alive, instead animated by some magic that
                    gives them purpose and movement.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Though the typical zombie is an animated corpse, this entry
                    also covers zombies which have either been animated by some
                    immoral science, or even living humans infected by some
                    disease or virus which has effectively turned them into the
                    living dead.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In either case, zombies are all similar in that they have
                    little or no will of their own, and are generally driven
                    either by hatred or hunger to attack and (often eat) those
                    who are still blessed with life.

                A virus infected human.

                    The <e>infected</e> are similar to zombies, but they
                    are not <e>undead</e>. Instead they are humans infected
                    by some 'natural' virus (or similar agent) that has
                    taken control of their bodies, removing their humanity
                    and leaving behind only a gaping hunger.
                </para>
                <para>
                    They are often faster moving than zombies, and can infect
                    others through wounds, or even close proximity.

                A corpse re-animated by black magic.

            <physical>
                <para>
                    Zombies are little more than animated corpses. Their
                    state of decay can vary immensely, but they generally
                    have enough flesh on their bones to hold themselves
                    together. Zombies which have rotted away to skeletons
                    are generally treated as undead <e>skeletons</e>.

                    Zombies generally move towards the living and try to
                    eat them.
