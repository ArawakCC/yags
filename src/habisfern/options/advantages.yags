    <advantage name="Dreaming" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+3"/>
        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Like many other people, you dream about the future. Unlike
                most others though, your dreams are a reflection of reality.
                You can't control what your dreams are about, but they tend
                to be events that will affect you. They don't necessarily show
                what will happen, but what could happen if certain decisions
                are made.
            </para>

            <para>
                A dream will occur when an important event is due to occur.
                Often, this will be once per adventure, though may vary
                depending on the structure of the campaign. It will give
                hints as to what is going to happen, showing something that
                could happen. Though they aren't always clear, they should
                generally be useful. Their focus tends to be on what is
                important personally though, rather than what is important
                globally. However, they will sometimes foreshadow future
                events that are far in the future.

    <advantage name="Second sight" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+3"/>
        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You can see creatures and places of the <e>Otherworld</e>,
                which are normally hidden to sight. Spirits, hauntings and
                echoes of the past are readily visible to you, and can
                sometimes be hard to discern from 'reality'. Otherworldly
                things will be attracted to you, for good or ill, due to
                your ability to converse with them. You can also sometimes
                see paths that lead to these realms, and can lead others
                there.
            </para>

            <para>
                Your sight will have probably marked you out as being
                different from an early age, and you will have a reputation
                of seeing and hearing things that others cannot. People
                who know you may distrust you, but will also recognise your
                ability as being potentially useful.
            </para>

    <advantage name="Wyrd" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+3"/>
        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                At your birth, an omen was seen, or a prophecy made about
                you which will lead you into into darkness, and cause
                pain and suffering for those around you.
            </para>

            <para>
                The good news is that fate will try and ensure that the
                prophecy will come to pass. It is not guaranteed, but if
                something should happen to you that would otherwise
                prevent you from fulfilling your prophecy (such as dying),
                then fate will try to arrange things otherwise.
            </para>

            <para>
                This can be similar to the effect of spending a luck point,
                but there will often be a darker twist to the method of
                your salvation.
            </para>

    <advantage name="Shapechanger" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+3"/>
        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You may take the form of an animal. You may only take
                the form of a single animal, and it must be roughly
                human sized - wolves are the most common form taken.
                When you change, none of your clothing or equipment
                will change with you, and the process normally takes
                about three rounds.
            </para>
            <para>
                You may not take a form that can fly, though you may
                take that of a sea creature. Certain cults may allow
                you further control over this ability.
            </para>
        </description>

    <advantage name="Luck" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+1"/>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You are lucky, and have one extra point of luck. You may take
                this as many times as you can afford.
            </para>
        </description>
    </advantage>

    <advantage name="Minor vow" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-1"/>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Everybody makes a vow of some sort, a few people will
                take a vow before the gods and dedicate their to keeping
                to it. You are one of these people. Choose a vow and a
                god, as well as a reason for having made the vow. If you
                ever break it, then you will suffer bad luck in your
                future endeavours (-5 to all luck checks) until you seek
                amends.
            </para>

            <para>
                A <e>minor vow</e> does not come up that often, or is not
                a great inconvenience (for the player, rather than the
                character). It includes such things as a vow of chastity,
                a vow to always share your meal, or never to wear red.
            </para>
        </description>
    </advantage>

    <advantage name="Major vow" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-3"/>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Everybody makes a vow of some sort, a few people will
                take a vow before the gods and dedicate their to keeping
                to it. You are one of these people. Choose a vow and a

            </para>

            <para>
                A <e>major vow</e> will either affect you much of the time,
                or is a great inconvenience. A vow to always offer to spare
                a foe (and to honour it), to never sleep under the same
                roof twice, to always honour an agreement.
