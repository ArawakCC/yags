            <title>Character Skills</title>

            <para>
                Skills are those abilities which a character develops
                throughout their life, and tend to change a lot more
                regularly than attributes do.
            </para>

            <para>
                How good a character is at a skill is rated as a value
                from zero upwards. A skill of four is acceptable for
                someone wanting to make a living with the skill. Higher
                skills are possible, though skills above six will be
                rare.
            </para>

            <para>
                Initial character development is divided into three
                broad categories - general skills, professional
                skills and adulthood. These should be worked through
                in the order given below.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the player has decided to play a non-human, then
                starting skills are somewhat different. This section
                should be read, in order to understand the ideas
                involved, and then the sections at the end on each of
                the non-human races should be used.
            </para>

                <title>General Skills</title>

                <para>
                    A general set of skills are learned throughout the character's
                    childhood and adolescence. For the most part, they are skills
                    which are common to everyone.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Talents</title>

                    <para>
                    Talents are skills which the majority of people have at least
                    some skill at, and even people with only zero skill are capable
                    of trying to use such skills without further penalty.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                    The talents are Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Guile,
                    Sleight, Stealth and Throw.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                    The player has twenty-four points to spend on these skills. No
                    skill can be given a score above 4, and all must have a score
                    of at least one. Skill cost is per the pyramid point cost system
                    as used for attributes.

                    <para>
                        A character will start with a reasonable
                        knowledge of the world they live in - though
                        their 'world' may well be limited to a single
                        village. This knowledge is represented by the
                        following three starting skills, which default
                        to the following scores.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Language skills are treated on a scale from
                        one to four, and are not normally 'rolled'
                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill
                        gives a guide to how much of a conversation a
                        character can understand.
                    </para>
                    
                    <termlist>
                        <entry term="Level one">
                            The character can recognise the language
                            and knows a few words, but cannot put
                            sentences together.
                        </entry>

                            The character can understand and form basic
                            sentences. The character can probably get by
                            in the market or in an inn.
                        </entry>
                        
                        <entry term="Level three">
                            The character has a good grasp of the
                            language and can hold a decent
                            conversation. They will obviously still be
                            a foreigner however, and many unusual words
                            will be beyond their understanding.
                        </entry>

                        <entry term="Level four">
                            The character is fluent in the language.
                            If they are a foreigner, then they may
                            still have an accent, but they will not
                            have any problems communicating.

                            level and beyond gives detailed knowledge of
                            different dialects and really obscure words,
                            but is not of use in everyday conversation.

                <para>
                    After the character's general skills have been
                    decided upon, the next step is to decide what
                    the character did during apprenticeship, which
                    takes the character up to the age of 16.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Apprenticeship provides the character with
                    thirty points of skills to put where they want,
                    though no skill can be raised above four
                    at this stage.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If desired, these points can be placed on
                    talents, as long as those skills are core to
                    the character concept.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The pre-generated characters given later give
                    skills generally associated with given
                    professions, and can be used as a guide for
                    choosing sensible skill combinations. A full
                    list of skills, together with their descriptions
                    is given at the end of this section, but for a
                    brief list of commonly available skills and their
                    difficulties, see the character sheet.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Once these skills have been assigned, the
                    character is considered to be an adult, and
                    ready to enter play. However, if a more experienced
                    character is desired then it is possible to age a
                    character beyond 16, gaining experience each
                    further year.

            <sect2>
                <title>Adulthood</title>

                <para>
                    At the age of 16, a character is assumed to be
                    an adult, and can enter play. Many players may
                    well feel that their character isn't quite
                    suited to the big outdoors quite yet, and will
                    want to develop them further.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For every year of extra development a character
                    has before they enter play, another two points
                    may be spent on skills.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Characters may begin at any age the player wants
                    above 16, but characters which start above 35
                    years of age will have to make aging rolls before
                    the game begins (so could possibly die).
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that characters are no more than
                    35 years old, for simple reasons of play balance.

                <para>
                    Talents are skills which all characters have some
                    experience with. They require no special training to
                    learn, and are normally picked up during early
                    childhood. They include basic physical skills, as
                    well as social interaction.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each talent covers quite a broad area, and can often
                    be used in place of other skills, though at a penalty.
                    All player characters have at least two in each talent,
                    and NPCs with lower skills will be rare.

                            in polite company. Normally based on

                            to. A guile roll can give a one-fifth bonus to the gambling skill
                            roll. Normally based on intelligence.

                    Cult skills are only available to members of a
                    given religion. In theory, they can be learned
                    by anyone, but it is generally forbidden
                    to teach them outside of the cult.

                            This skill is only known by the clerics and fighting
                            orders of Agrik. It mimics the advantage of the same name. It
                            is based on stamina, and each 10 points rolled gives an equivalence
                            to one level of berserker advantage.

                            It is believed that dreams give glimpses of the inner
                            mind of a person, and also of their future. The ability to
                            understand dreams, and to garner useful knowledge from them is
                            difficult to master. At worst though, someone with this skill
                            can give impressive interpretations of a dream, if not entirely
                            accurate. Based on intelligence, and taught by the priests of Siem.
