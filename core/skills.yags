            <title>Character Skills</title>

            <para>
                Skills are those abilities which a character develops
                throughout their life, and tend to change a lot more
                regularly than attributes do.
            </para>

            <para>
                How good a character is at a skill is rated as a value
                from zero upwards. A skill of four is acceptable for
                someone wanting to make a living with the skill. Higher
                skills are possible, though skills above six will be
                rare amongst the common population
            </para>

            <para>
                Initial character development is divided into three
                broad categories - general skills, professional
                skills and adulthood. These should be worked through
                in the order given below.
            </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Standard skills</title>

                    <para>
                        Most skills are considered to be <e>standard
                        skills</e>. Such skills can be learnt relatively
                        easily, including being self taught. They can also
                        be used by a character who has a skill of zero,
                        though such an attempt fumbles on a natural one
                        or two.

                <sect3>
                    <title>Talents</title>

                    <para>
                        Talents are skills which are known by everyone
                        from childhood onwards. They are treated just as
                        standard skills, with the exception that all
                        characters start with a skill level of two in all
                        talents.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        There are only eight talents, and are listed by
                        default on the character sheet. Talents are
                        sometimes marked with an asterix (*).
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Knowledges</title>

                    <para>
                        A knowledge is a special type of skill which cannot
                        be attempted unless the character has a skill level
                        of at least one. They can rarely be self taught,
                        requiring a teacher or study aid (such as a book)
                        to learn from.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Languages</title>

                    <para>
                        Language skills are treated on a scale from
                        one to four, and are not normally 'rolled'
                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill
                        gives a guide to how much of a conversation a
                        character can understand.
                    </para>

                    <itemlist order="strict">
                        <item name="Level one">
                            The character can recognise the language
                            and knows a few words, but cannot put
                            sentences together.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Level two">
                            The character can understand and form basic
                            sentences. The character can probably get by
                            in the market or in an inn.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Level three">
                            The character has a good grasp of the
                            language and can hold a decent
                            conversation. They will obviously still be
                            a foreigner however, and many unusual words
                            will be beyond their understanding.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Level four">
                            The character is fluent in the language.
                            If they are a foreigner, then they may
                            still have an accent, but they will not
                            have any problems communicating.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Level five and above">
                            If the character is a non-native speaker,
                            then they can speak without an accent. This
                            level and beyond gives detailed knowledge of
                            different dialects and really obscure words,
                            but is not of use in everyday conversation.

                <title>Skill Rules</title>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Defaults</title>

                    <para>
                        Some skills have a default - this will generally be
                        one of the <e>talents</e>. If desired, the default
                        can be used instead, but the result (after the die
                        roll) is halved, plus the chance of fumbling is
                        doubled.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A default skill may also restrict the type of
                        tasks which are possible. For example, <e>Trade</e>
                        defaults to <e>Guile</e>, but the latter can only
                        be used to barter, and isn't much use if the
                        character needs to know the real value of goods.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Pre-requisites</title>

                    <para>
                        A few skills have pre-requisites. Before this skill
                        can be purchased at level one, all pre-requisites
                        must be met. A skill like Physics might have a
                        pre-requisite of Mathematics-2 and Science-2 for
                        example, which means both skills must be known at
                        level 2 before buying physics.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Further, the main skill may never be more than
                        double the level of any of the pre-requisites. A
                        physicist would have to raise their Mathematics
                        and Science to at least 3, before raising
                        Physics to 6.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A character cannot put points into a skill if the
                        next level of skill is not allowed.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Limited Skills</title>

                    <para>
                        Under some genres, a skill may be <e>limited</e>
                        by another skill. This concept is mostly limited to
                        knowledge or science skills. When a skill is limited
                        by another skill, the first skill may never be more
                        than half the score of the second.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For example, during the <e>Enlightenment</e>, when
                        Science was being discovered, the Science skill is
                        limited by Natural Philosophy. If a character has
                        a Natural Philosophy of 7, then their Science
                        cannot be higher than 3 (since raising it any higher
                        would make it greater than 3.5). Once the
                        character's Natural Philosophy has been raised to
                        8, then they can begin to raise their Science to 4.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        A character cannot put points into a skill if the
                        next level of skill is not allowed.

                <sect3>
                    <title>Techniques</title>

                    <para>
                        <e>Techniques</e> are advantages and are described
                        in full in the <s>Advantages</s> article.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Some skills have techniques associated with them.
                        When the skill reaches a certain level (the level
                        of the technique) then the technique may be
                        purchased as an advantage. Techniques generally
                        allow the skill to be used in a different way, or
                        give bonuses to certain uses of the skill.

                Next is given the skill <e>default</e> and

                pre-requisite is the minimum score that is needed in

            <para>
                The main body of text describes the skill - what it
                does and how it can be used. Some skills can be used in
                different ways for different tasks, and if these sub
                tasks are sufficiently different or important, then
                they will be listed under a sub heading (for our
                Medicine example, Diagnosis is listed as a sub-task).

                    designing a character that you want to be good at
                    some type of thing, these grouping can give an

            <title>Genre Specific Skills</title>

            <para>
                The following skills are specific to certain genres. Though
                time periods are suggested, the cut over between the
                different eras is difficult to place, and some campaigns
                may want to borrow from multiple skill lists.
            </para>

            <para>
                In some cases, a skill is listed in two or more genres,
                with a different description each time. This is because
                what the skill covers is different in each genre, though
                what it is attempting to cover, and what it is called,
                is pretty similar (the sciences are a good example of
                this).
            </para>

                <title>The Enlightenment</title>

                <para>
                    The <e>Enlightenment</e> covers the period between about
                    the 17th century and 19th century. By the turn of the
                    20th century, the <e>Modern</e> era has definitely begun,
                    but the change over point could be placed anywhere in
                    the 19th.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The <e>Enlightenment</e> sees the birth of science, and
                    so the biggest change in this period to previous ones
                    is changes and additions to the knowledges. Old knowledges
                    still exist, but what they cover has changed. New
                    knowledges (the sciences) are beginning to come into
                    their own, however they are still held back by classical
                    thinking, and are not as flexible as they are in the
                    <e>Modern</e> period.

                <title>Modern</title>

                <para>
                    The <e>Modern</e> period nominally starts around 1900,
                    but could be placed as early as the mid 19th century.
                    The industrial revolution has happened, and classical
                    modes of thinking have been swept away.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There is a huge increase in the number of knowledge
                    skills (mostly sciences, but also engineering skills),
                    and the increase in literacy and education means that
                    such skills are more widely known.
