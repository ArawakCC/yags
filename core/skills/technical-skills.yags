                This covers basic computer use, from switching it on
                to using a word processor, browsing the web or sending
                an email. High levels of skill will allow basic
                programming tasks and diagnosing faults.

            <para>
                A hacker is someone who has in depth knowledge of how
                computer systems work. Sometimes, this knowledge can be
                put towards circumventing security on computer systems,
                but doesn't have to. This skill covers programming,
                system design, network administration and most other
                advanced tasks.

                The point-and-click style of system administration can

                doesn't include much knowledge of why things work the

                This skill provides advanced knowledge of how to use
                communication devices such as radios. It does not just
                cover how to switch a device on and talk into it, since
                that is covered by basic <t>Intelligence</t>, but provides
                in depth knowledge of how to fix it when things go wrong,
                how to get around jamming, how to jam someone else's
                communications, and how to improve signal strength.
