            <title>Creating a Character</title>

            <para>
                The Character is the player's representation within
                the game world. From a game persective, they are
                described with numbers representing how strong they
                are, what they know and which skills they have
                training in. However, most of the interesting
                part of the character comes from how the player
                roleplays them.
            </para>

            <para>
                How to roleplay a character is not described here,
                since it is assumed that the reader has some degree
                of familiarity with roleplaying and character
                design.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is also assumed that the reader has read the
                Yags Introduction, since this describes the basic
                system, and how skills and attributes work within
                the game world.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Finally, this article describes the core rules for
                designing a basic Yags character. A fantasy setting
                is assumed. For character options relating to a
                particular setting, see the articles for character
                generation in that setting.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>A Points Based Generation System</title>

                <para>
                    Characters in Yags are designed with a points
                    based system, with no random determination. The
                    sort of character that comes out of the process
                    should be reasonably competent, though not
                    necessarily heroic.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Age does play a factor, in that the player may
                    choose the age of their character, and this will
                    affect how skilled the character is. Up to a point,
                    there are few disadvantages with starting with an
                    older character.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Initially, all characters begin at the age of
                    16. The process of generating an older character
                    occurs after initial character generation.

        <sect1>
            <title>Building a Character</title>

            <para>
                The player begins with 30 points to spend on their new
                character. The character starts with basic attributes
                and skills, which may be bought up with the character
                points, or entirely new skills or advantages may be
                purchased.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Basic Abilities</title>

                <para>
                    A character begins with all attributes at a score
                    of three, and all talents at a score of two. Further,
                    the following skills are known by all characters:
                    Speak own language 4, Area lore 2 and Folk lore 2.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    The character also begins with the passions Bravery,
                    Ego, Restraint and Temperence all at four.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All other skills and abilities have to be bought.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The obvious thing to buy is more skills. Any skill
                    may be bought up to a maximum level of 4 (which
                    costs 10 points).
                </para>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Attributes</title>

                <para>
                    Attributes may be bought up at three times normal
                    cost. So. to raise an attribute from three to four
                    would cost 12 character points. To raise it again
                    to five, would cost a further 15 character points,
                    for a total of 27.
                </para>

                <para>
                    An attribute can be bought down to two, which gives
                    an extra nine character points. No attribute can be
                    lowered below two however.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    Advantages can be raised during the game, though
                    the cost is increased to five times normal cost.
                </para>
            </sect2>

            <sect2>
                <title>Passions</title>

                <para>
                    Passions can be bought up, or lowered. Buying up
                    a passion costs two points for each +1, up to a
                    maximum score of six. A passion may also be bought
                    down, giving two points for each point a passion
                    is dropped, down to a minimum of two.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Passions can be raised in the game, but at normal
                    skill point costs. This makes it very cheap to raise
                    passions during character generation.
                </para>
            </sect2>


            <sect2>
                <title>Advantages and Disadvantages</title>

                <para>
                    Instead of skills and attributes, a player can opt
                    to buy advantages. These are special bonuses which
                    grant the character an edge over others. They may be
                    good looks, social contacts, or special physical or
                    mental characteristics.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Similarly, there are disadvantages which penalise the
                    character. Disadvantages have a negative cost, and
                    allow the player to spend more points elsewhere.
                </para>
            </sect2>
            
            <sect2>
                <title>Skills</title>
                
                <para>
                    A character will need to buy skills. Skills can be
                    bought up to a maximum level of four, whether they
                    are talents or normal skills.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    Depending on the character background, the GM may
                    restrict the purchase of certain skills.
                </para>

            <para>
                Edges and flaws modify a characters attributes under
                certain circumstances. They give either a +1 (if an
                edge) or a -1 (if a flaw) to the attribute for purposes
                of that roll. Only a single edge (the best one) can
                apply in any given situation. Likewise, only a single
                flaw (the worst) will apply. However, if an edge and
                a flaw overlap, they will cancel each other.

        <sect1>
            <title>Skills</title>

            <para>
                Skills are those abilities which a character develops
                throughout their life, and tend to change a lot more
                regularly than attributes do.
            </para>

            <para>
                How good a character is at a skill is rated as a value
                from zero upwards. A skill of four is acceptable for
                someone wanting to make a living with the skill. Higher
                skills are possible, though skills above six will be
                rare.
            </para>

            <para>
                Initial character development is divided into three
                broad categories - general skills, professional
                skills and adulthood. These should be worked through
                in the order given below.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the player has decided to play a non-human, then
                starting skills are somewhat different. This section
                should be read, in order to understand the ideas
                involved, and then the sections at the end on each of
                the non-human races should be used.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>General Skills</title>

                <para>
                    A general set of skills are learned throughout the character's
                    childhood and adolescence. For the most part, they are skills
                    which are common to everyone.
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Talents</title>

                    <para>
                    Talents are skills which the majority of people have at least
                    some skill at, and even people with only zero skill are capable
                    of trying to use such skills without further penalty.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                    The talents are Athletics, Awareness, Brawl, Charm, Guile,
                    Sleight, Stealth and Throw.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                    The player has twenty-four points to spend on these skills. No
                    skill can be given a score above 4, and all must have a score
                    of at least one. Skill cost is per the pyramid point cost system
                    as used for attributes.

                    <para>
                        A character will start with a reasonable
                        knowledge of the world they live in - though
                        their 'world' may well be limited to a single
                        village. This knowledge is represented by the
                        following three starting skills, which default
                        to the following scores.

                    <para>
                        Language skills are treated on a scale from
                        one to four, and are not normally 'rolled'
                        like other skills. Instead, the level of skill
                        gives a guide to how much of a conversation a
                        character can understand.

                    After the character's general skills have been
                    decided upon, the next step is to decide what
                    the character did during apprenticeship, which
                    takes the character up to the age of 16.

                <para>
                    Apprenticeship provides the character with
                    thirty points of skills to put where they want,
                    though no skill can be raised above four
                    at this stage.

                <para>
                    If desired, these points can be placed on
                    talents, as long as those skills are core to

                    character beyond 16, gaining experience each

                <para>
                    At the age of 16, a character is assumed to be
                    an adult, and can enter play. Many players may
                    well feel that their character isn't quite
                    suited to the big outdoors quite yet, and will
                    want to develop them further.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For every year of extra development a character
                    has before they enter play, another two points
                    may be spent on skills.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Characters may begin at any age the player wants
                    above 16, but characters which start above 35
                    years of age will have to make aging rolls before
                    the game begins (so could possibly die).
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that characters are no more than
                    35 years old, for simple reasons of play balance.
