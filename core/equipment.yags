            <title>Encumbrance</title>

            <para>
                How much a person can carry is based on their strength.
                The more they carry, the greater the penalties when trying
                to perform physical actions. A character can normally
                carry up to the square of their strength (in kg) without
                any penalty. If they try to carry more than this, then
                they are penalised.
            </para>

            <para>
                The following table shows the penalties for given levels
                of encumbrance. The encumbrance column lists the maximum
                load that can be carried as a multiple of their base
                amount (strength squared).
            </para>

            <targetlist targetFirst="false" bold="true">
                <valueLabel>Encumbrance</valueLabel>
                <targetLabel>Level</targetLabel>

                <item target="0" value="Unencumbered (x1).">
                    A character can carry up to the square of their
                    strength without being encumbered.
                </item>

                <item target="1" value="Light (x2).">
                    A character who carries more than the square of their
                    strength (but no more than twice this) is lightly
                    encumbered, and has a -1 penalty to agility.
                </item>

                <item target="2" value="Moderately (x3).">
                    Character has a -1 penalty to both agility and
                    dexterity.
                </item>

                <item target="3" value="Heavily (x6).">
                    Character has a -2 penalty to agility and a -1
                    penalty to dexterity.
                </item>

                <item target="4" value="Greatly (x10).">
                    A greatly burdened character has a -2 penalty to
                    both agility and dexterity.
                </item>

                <item target="5" value="Over encumbered.">
                    Character cannot move, all agility checks are
                    automatically zero and -2 to dexterity.
                </item>
            </targetlist>

            <para>
                The level of encumbrance is used in other situations.
                When fatigue checks are made, it gives a -5 to the
                roll per level of encumbrance.
            </para>

            <para>
                It may also add a similar penalty if the character attempts
                some athletic action that would be greatly affected by
                encumbrance. Examples include jumping, swimming or
                acrobatics.

            <para>
                There is a wide variety of armour available, varying in
                cost, weight and protective ability. Some armour is better
                against certain types of weapons than other armour -
                padded cloth can be better against crushing weapons than
                mail is, though mail is far superior against swords.

                    Light armour is ineffective against heavy weapons, but
