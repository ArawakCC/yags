            <para>
                This is a basic introduction to the <tm>Yags</tm>
                combat system, and a description of low tech fighting,
                using swords, bows and brawling. Modern day warfare
                is covered in <ref>Modern Combat</ref> and futuristic
                combat is covered in <ref>Future Combat</ref>.

                <para>
                    The following terms are used frequently within
                    these rules, so they are described up front. A
                    full description of how they are used will be
                    given later.
                </para>

                <termlist sort="true">
                    <entry term="Round">
                        A round is a unit of time, averaging about five
                        seconds. Each round, a character has chance to
                        perform a single action - normally an attack or a
                        move.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Body levels">
                        Every creature has a number of body levels, which
                        represent their ability to absorb damage. The number
                        of body levels determines how many wounds and stuns
                        a creature can take before it falls over.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Soak">
                        Soak is how good a creature is at
                        resisting (soaking) damage. An adult
                        human will usually have a base soak of
                        12. Any armour worn adds to this.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Wounds">
                        Wounds are serious injuries which have a good chance
                        of causing death. Most weapons cause wound damage.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Stuns">
                        Stuns are non-serious injuries which result in pain
                        and bruises, which rarely kill. Excessive stun
                        damage will result in wounds being caused.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Mixed damage">
                        Mixed damage is half stuns, half wounds. The first
                        level is a wound, the second a stun, the third a
                        wound etc. Often caused by animals.
                    </entry>
                    
                    <entry term="Fatigue">
                        Fatigue is a measure of how tired a creature is.
                        Unlike wounds and stuns, the amount of fatigue a
                        creature can handle is based on their stamina.
                        There are two types of fatigue - temporary and
                        permanent. Temporary fatigue is more common in
                        combat, and can be recovered with a short rest.
                        Permanent fatigue can only be recovered after a
                        good nights sleep, but is only gained through
                        sleep deprivation or after several hours of
                        physical effort.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Damage">
                        Damage is done when one creature hits
                        another. Often, damage induces wounds or
                        stuns in the target. An attack will
                        inflict either <term>wounds</term>,
                        <term>stuns</term> or <term>mixed</term>
                        damage which is split between stuns and
                        wounds. Many animals cause mixed damage
                        with claw and bite attacks.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Load">
                        A character can carry a load equal to four times
                        their strength without penalty. Weapons, armour
                        and equipment carried add to load.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Technique">
                        A technique is a special action taken during an
                        attack, which either gives a bonus, or provides some
                        special effect. Techniques are considered to be
                        advantages, which must be learnt before they can be
                        used.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Stance">
                        Stance determines how a combatent is fighting, the
                        most common being normal, aggressive and defensive.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Free strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent gets a free
                        defence roll, at the same penalty as other defence
                        rolls that round if multiple defences have been
                        declared.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Automatic strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent does not get
                        a defence roll, so the attack is against the base
                        difficulty to hit the target.

                    <entry term="Good success">
                        A <e>good</e> success is one that is at least 5 above
                        the target number required. Often described as a
                        <e>good defence</e> or a <e>good attack</e>.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Excellent success">
                        An <e>excellent</e> success is one that is at least 10
                        above the target number required.

                    <entry term="Superb success">
                        A <e>superb</e> success is one that is at least 15 above
                        the target number required. For example, a <e>superb
                        defence</e> is 15 points higher than the attack it was
                        defending against.

                    <entry term="Unsteady">
                        An <e>unsteady</e> combatent is one who is down on
                        their knees, or otherwise does not have secure
                        footing. It is a half way state between <e>prone</e>
                        and normal posture.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Prone">
                        A <e>prone</e> person is down on the floor, and
                        unable to act effectively. Attacks and defence are
                        possible from such a position, but they are
                        difficult.

                <title>Fighting Styles</title>

                <para>
                    Every creature has a style of fighting, which determines
                    how they use their weapons. All combat using natural
                    weapons uses the <e>Brawling</e> style. Combat with
                    melee or missile weapons uses the style associated with
                    the type of weapon being used.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each style is associated with a skill of the same name.
                    Only a single skill is needed to cover use of all weapons
                    which can be used with that style of fighting. It is
                    possible to use any melee weapon with any melee style,
                    though at a penalty.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the weapon combination used is not applicable, the
                    combat bonuses of the weapon are halved. Further, all
                    attacks are slow, and all attack and defence rolls
                    fumble on a 1-2 rather than a 1 (unless brawl is being
                    used, in which case only fumble on a 1). No techniques
                    can be used.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If using a second weapon, or a shield, only half the
                    defence bonus of the second weapon applies (all other
                    bonuses of the second weapon are ignored).
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Brawling</title>

                    <para>
                        Brawling is the simplest style of fighting,
                        involving punching, kicking and grappling. It also
                        covers the use of simple weapons such as a knife,
                        dagger or broken bottle.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When using a brawling attack, the initiative,
                        attack, defence and damage bonuses of the weapon
                        (or the natural bonuses of the creature) add to
                        the combat rolls.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Single weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        A fighting style involving a single melee weapon,
                        such as a dagger, sword or mace. Most one handed
                        weapons can be used with this style.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Weapon and shield</title>

                    <para>
                        This fighting style uses a combination of a one
                        handed weapon and a shield, to give what is
                        possibly the best combination. Any type of shield,
                        and any one handed weapon can be used with this
                        style (anything which has a style of <e>single</e>
                        in other words).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The full combat bonuses of the shield are added to
                        the combat bonuses of the primary weapon.
                    </para>

                    <title>Great weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        The great weapon style allows use of a single
                        weapon which requires two hands to use it. It
                        suffers from lack of defence, but such weapons
                        can be very good at cleaving through armour.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Two weapons</title>

                    <para>
                        This style of fighting involves the use of two one
                        handed weapons at once. Though this gives an edge
                        over only using one weapon, it does not grant two
                        attacks in a combat round. Further, it is
                        generally not as good as using a shield instead
                        of a second weapon, but it does have its advantages.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Half the combat bonuses of the secondary weapon
                        (rounded up) are added to the die rolls. The minimum
                        strength requirement of the second weapon is also
                        increased by one.
                    </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Longshaft weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        This style of fighting uses a single two handed
                        weapon such as a long spear, quarterstaff or
                        lance, or single handed versions of the same. A
                        shield may be used if the weapon is one handed, as
                        if using the <e>Weapon and shield</e> style.
                    </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Flail weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        Flails are a small category of weapon which are
                        quite rare, consisting of a number of balls or
                        rods, attached via chain or leather to a haft.
                        They can be used with or without a shield. They
                        have the advantage that when used defensively,

                    Each weapon has a number of properties which
                    represents how effective it is. These give a bonus
                    to a character's skill checks in combat. All
                    bonuses are zero or positive - no weapon gives a
                    negative adjustment to combat actions.

                    Creatures which have natural attacks have their
                    own combat modifiers, depending on the nature of
                    their natural weapons. Generally, these are worse
                    than those of man made weapons. Size, reach and
                    sharpness all have a say in how effective natural
                    weapons are for a given type of creature.

                weapons. The rules for melee combat form the basis
                of other forms of combat as well (such as ranged
                combat), so the basic rules of combat are

                        At the start of each round, all combatents declare
                        their actions simultaneously. Since a round is five
                        seconds, there is generally time to notice what
                        everyone else is doing before committing. If someone
                        takes a long time deciding on their action however,
                        then they loose it for that round.

                        If a character is performing an attack, then stance
                        and techniques should be declared at this point.
                        Once all attacks have been declared, characters can
                        declare which attacks they are defending against.

                        Action determination is considered to be
                        simultaneous for everyone. If a character
                        wishes to 'wait' then they must declare what
                        they are waiting for, and what they will do
                        when it happens. Declarations such as
                        <e>I'll hit him if he moves</e>
                        are perfectly valid.

                            determines what actions and techniques are
                            possible. Sometimes, stance is determined before
                            hand due to circumstances - a character who has
                            been knocked to the floor is considered to be

                                following round, otherwise they are unsteady

                        fast. Fast actions always come before other
                        actions, and slow actions always go after all
                        other actions. When resolving initiative, resolve
                        all fast actions first, then all normal actions,
                        then all slow actions. In a few circumstances,
                        an action may be very slow, in which case these
                        are resolved last. Use of some special attacks
                        will make an action slow or fast.

                            then two things occur. First, the character
                            acts in the next speed category down, so a
                            normal action becomes slow, and a slow action
                            becomes very slow.

                        to not defend against all attacks, in order to
                        at least have a chance at defending against some
                        of them. It is not possible to defend against more

            <title>Damage and Wounds</title>

            <para>
                A successful attack can result in damage and/or death to
                the defender. Damage is represented as either wounds or
                stuns - the former being by far the most deadly. Most
                weapons cause wounds, whilst punching someone will cause
                stun damage. Stuns are temporary, and even the worst stun
                damage will be recovered in a few days.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some attacks will cause a mixture of stuns and wounds.
                Animal attacks are often of this kind.
            </para>

            <para>
                Damage is measured in levels, and is calculated from the
                damage roll of the attacker and the soak roll of the
                defender. Soak, which includes basic toughness plus
                protective armour, reduces damage suffered from an attack.
            </para>

            <para>
                To find the damage, roll the strength x 4 + weapon damage
                bonus of the attacker, and subtract the base soak + armour
                soak roll of the defender. A typical human has a base soak
                of 12. A full suite of chain armour gives a further +13
                soak, for a total of 25. A typical human with a strength
                of 3 and using a sword has a damage of 3 x 4 + 12 = 24.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the damage roll is higher than the soak roll, then
                damage of some kind has been caused. For every five points
                (or part thereof) higher, one level of injury is suffered
                by the target. The effects of these injury levels depends
                on the damage type of the weapon - wounds, stuns or split
                damage.

                <title>Knockdown</title>
                
                <para>
                    Every creature has a <e>knockdown</e> score, which is
                    the amount of damage a creature can stand in one blow
                    and still remain standing. Knockdown calculation is
                    performed before armour and soak is subtracted from the
                    damage, so it is possible to knock someone to the floor,
                    even if you don't get through their armour.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    The knockdown score for a person or creature is equal
                    to their <skillequation><attribute>strength</attribute>
                    <skill>10</skill><bonus>10</bonus></skillequation>
                    For an average human, this
                    is equal to 40. If a blow equals or exceeds this value,
                    then the creature receives one stun regardless of their
                    soak. They must then make an
                    <skillequation><attribute>agility</attribute>
                    <skill>brawl</skill></skillequation> roll to remain

                <para>
                    The brawl roll is at a target difficulty of 20 plus
                    the amount the damage was over the character's
                    knockdown.

                <para>
                    Wounds represent damage that has a good chance of
                    breaking the skin and affecting vital organs, or
                    causing massive bleeding or broken bones. Every
                    injury level causes one wound, and wounds are
                    cumulative from one attack to the next. If a person
                    takes two wounds from one attack, and three wounds
                    from a second attack the following round, they have
                    a total of five wounds.

                        If a character becomes fatally wounded, then they
                        must immediately make a stamina roll at difficulty 20
                        or die (with a fumble chance of 3, fumbling resulting
                        in death). If they get a good success (succeed by 10
                        or more), then they may continue normally, otherwise
                        they fall unconscious.

                        <para>
                            If a character suffers damage that takes them
                            beyond <e>fatally wounded</e>,
                            then they are considered to be at fatal, but
                            the initial stamina difficulty is raised by 5
                            for each wound level beyond fatal they were
                            taken. For example, if someone is seriously
                            wounded, and suffers four extra wound levels,
                            they will become fatally wounded, and need
                            to make a stamina roll at difficulty 30 to
                            remain alive, and 40 to remain conscious.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The fumble chance is raised by 1 for each
                            wound beyond fatal that they are taken.

                        <para>
                            Damage such as this only affects the initial
                            stamina roll, and does not affect further
                            rolls to remain conscious and alive later on.
                            For all other purposes, there are no shades
                            of fatal wounds.

                <title>Stuns</title>

                <para>
                    Unlike wounds, stuns are short term and generally
                    non-fatal. Stun damage is caused by attacks which
                    bruise or scratch such as fists, chair legs and
                    staffs. It is possible to kill someone with stun
                    damage, though it is unlikely.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Unlike wounds, stun damage is not cumulative. If a
                    character receives a number of stuns greater than
                    the stun levels they currently have, then they become
                    stunned to that level. The stuns are not added to
                    the stuns they already have.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a character receives at least one or more stuns
                    which do not exceed their current stun level, then
                    they gain one stun.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Similar to wounds, a character suffers penalties
                    from being stunned. The penalties are on a similar
                    scale for wound penalties, and a character who is
                    both wounded and stunned suffers both sets of
                    penalties.

                    they must make a stamina roll of difficulty 30 or fall

                    requires another stamina roll, plus the character

                <para>
                    Some weapons have a damage type of
                    <e>Mixed</e>, which causes both stun and
                    wound damage. On a scale of severity, it isn't as deadly
                    as wound damage, but is worse than stun damage.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Mixed damage is split equally between stuns and wounds,
                    with any remainder going on stuns (so one level of

                    All stuns from mixed damage are cumulative. If a
                    character receives three levels of mixed damage, he
                    suffers two stuns and one wound. If that character
                    already has two stuns and two wounds, he will now
                    have four stuns and three wounds.

                <para>
                    Fatigue is not strictly damage, but it is treated
                    in much the same way as damage is, so is described
                    here. Fatigue is gained due to strenuous exercise,
                    some mental/magical attacks or lack of sleep. Depending
                    on the magic system used, spell casting can also result
                    in fatigue being gained.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As for other types of <e>damage</e>,
                    fatigue is measured in levels, each level giving a
                    penalty to all actions. These levels range from 'OK'
                    to 'Exhausted'.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There are types of fatigue - temporary and permanent.
                    Unless stated otherwise, all fatigue gained is temporary
                    and can be lost with a short rest.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All fatigue is recorded on the same track. If a person
                    has two points of temporary fatigue and two points of
                    permanent fatigue, then for purposes of everything save
                    for recovery, they have four points of fatigue. For
                    someone with a stamina of 3, this would give them a
                    single -6 penalty, not two -1 penalties.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that fatigue is kept track of on the
                    character sheet by crossing off temporary fatigue levels
                    with a single line, and permanent fatigue with a cross.

            <title>Armour</title>

            <para>
                The purpose of armour is to keep someone alive by absorbing
                or deflecting the force of a blow away from them. In reality,
                the relationship between weapons and armour is complicated,
                having evolved during an arms race lasting several millennia.
                As a type of armour was developed to counter the weapons
                then in use, so the weapons changed to minimise the effects
                of the new armour.
            </para>

            <para>
                Realistically, it is not always possible to say that one
                type of armour is better at stopping damage than another
                type. The usefulness of armour depends on whether the
                attack crushes, slices or pierces, and there are
                complications within these as well. Yags however,
                deliberately ignores this. Armour has a single
                protection value which works equally against all types
                of armour.
            </para>

            <para>
                A further simplification is that there are no hit locations.
                The protection value of armour also takes into account how
                much of the body it covers. It is left to GMs to rule when
                an attack can avoid armour - generally this will only be
                possible against an unsuspecting foe.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Choosing armour</title>

                <para>
                    A full set of armour can consist of several parts, and a
                    character can mix and match according to preference and
                    finances. Generally, armour cannot be layered - it is 
                    not possible to wear two chain hauberks at the same time.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each item of armour has a protection value, and a load.
                    The total load and protection of all worn items is
                    totalled to give the final value. So, a character
                    wearing soft leather trousers (with a protection of 2)
                    and a soft leather jacket (also 2), would have
                    a total armour protection of 4.

                        Normally, it is not possible to layer armour on top
                        of other armour - if it is managed, only the highest
                        protection value is applied. However, some types of
                        armour are designed to layer, and in this case the 
                        protection values are added together.

                        Soft leather armour can be worn underneath chain or
                        plate armour. Plate armour such as greaves, vambraces
                        and breastplates can be worn over chain armour. It 
                        is possible to wear plate over chain over leather.

                        The other layering combination is that a helm can

                    After a character has become injured, it may be
                    necessary for first aid to be applied to the wounds
                    in order for them to heal. Fresh wounds need to be
                    stabilised, a process which requires another
                    character to make an intelligence x first aid roll
                    on the wounded character.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The base difficulty to successfully first aid a
                    character's stuns is zero. To tend to a character's
                    wounds, the base difficulty is 10. In both cases, the
                    difficulty is modified upwards by the character's
                    total stun and wound penalties.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, a battered (-6) and lightly wounded (-1)
                    character would be difficulty 7 to first aid their
                    stuns, and 17 to first aid their wounds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A character may first aid themselves - as long as they
                    are conscious - but they suffer all their wound
                    penalties to their skill roll (as well as them adding
                    to the difficulty of the task).

                        A successful first aid attempt against stuns will
                        heal one level of stun immediately, plus a further

                        above the difficulty.

                    <para>
                        Stuns do not need to be stabalised, so there is no
                        penalty from failing to have first aid performed as
                        long as the character is only stunned.

                        A successful first aid attempt against wounds will
                        stabalise the wound, preventing it from becoming
                        infected or worsening. If the roll was at least 10
                        points higher than the difficulty, then a single
                        wound level is immediately healed.

                    <para>
                        A character who is fatally wounded, does not have
                        to roll to see if they die while the first aid
                        attempt is in progress. However, if the first aid
                        fails (at the end of the minute it takes), then
                        the character has to start rolling again as per
                        normal.

                    <para>
                        If a wound is not successfully first aided within
                        an hour, then there is a chance that it becomes
                        infected and worsens. The character makes a stamina
                        roll at difficulty 20, modified by wound penalties.
                        Failure means that the wound is infected, and
                        worsens by one level. Each day thereafter, until
                        first aid is successfully attempted, another roll
                        is needed, with each failure worsening the wound
                        each time.

                        modified by their current wound and stun penalties.
                        Success means that one stun level is healed, and each
                        10 above the difficulty heals a further stun level.

                        If the character fumbles their stamina roll, then

                        level. A character who is already fatally wounded
                        will die.

                        skill can grant a bonus if they spend time
                        looking after the wounded person. An intelligence
                        x first aid skill roll is made, and a bonus of

                    <para>
                        The only way to recover from fatigue is through
                        rest. Temporary fatigue can be recovered in a
                        matter of minutes, whilst permanent fatigue can
                        only be recovered with a good sleep.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For each level of fatigue a person has, it takes
                        five minutes to recover one temporary level. If a
                        person has four levels of temporary fatigue, then
                        it takes 20 minutes of rest to loose the first level,
                        then 15 minutes for the next level, 10 minutes for
                        the third level and finally 5 minutes for the last
                        level.

                    <para>
                        Permanent fatigue counts towards temporary fatigue,
                        but can not be lost through simple rest. A person
                        with two permanent fatigue and two temporary, could
                        loose the temporary fatigue after 35 minutes, but
                        would need a night of rest to loose the rest.

                    <para>
                        Permanent fatigue is recovered after a night of

                        fatigue automatically, and one point of permanent

                        The bow, including both the longbow and shortbow,
                        requires this skill. The bow can be quite a deadly
                        weapon in the hands of a skilled professional, but
                        can be difficult to use.

                        Both longbows and shortbows are constructed for a

                        both the minimum and maximum strength. A stronger 
                        bowman cannot use their full strength when
                        using the weapon.

                        Longbows have the advantage that a skilled longbowman
                        can manage a larger 'pull' then an unskilled one of
                        equivalent strength (due to long hours spent
                        exercising wrist and arm muscles). For every full
                        four points of skill a longbowman has, then they
                        get an effective +1 to their strength when using a

                    As for melee combat, there is a base difficulty needed
                    to hit a target. Unlike in melee combat though, this is
                    modified by the range to the target, and environmental
                    factors such as wind and visibility.

                <para>
                    For a human sized target, the base difficulty is 15, as
                    for melee combat. For smaller or larger targets, the
                    difficulty changes however.

                        The range increment is a measure of how accurate the

                        each multiple of this distance gives a +5 modifier
                        to the target difficulty.

                        Weapons such as bows, crossbows, hurled weapons and

                        hit targets at medium or long range. Targets at
                        short range can be hit on a more or less flat
                        trajectory. So, for example, it is not possible to
                        fire at long range down a low corridor.

                        the range is needed in height. Firing a long bow at
                        a target 200m away, requires 100m of height, since
                        this is at long range.

                        can hit the window, but not someone behind the
                        window. At medium range, it is possible to hit
                        someone immediately behind a window or similar gap,
                        but it would not be possible to fire through a

                    <para>
                        One problem with missile weapons is that it is not
                        possible to parry with them. If the weapon has an
                        equivalent melee defence total, then use the defence
                        total for that (i.e. a thrown dagger is treated as
                        a melee dagger for defence), otherwise it
                        is not possible to parry with a missile weapon.
                        Instead, the character must perform a brawling
                        defence (agility x brawl), with no modifier for
                        the weapon being used.

                    <para>
                        Firing into a melee combat is rarely a good idea,
                        but sometimes it is done anyway. If the target of
                        a missile attack is in close combat with anyone
                        else, then the fumble chance of the attack is
                        increased by two for each extra person. Firing
                        into a melee involving six people, would give a +10
                        to the fumble chance, meaning the attacker has a
                        chance of hitting the wrong target if the d20 rolls
                        less than 12.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The chance of fumbling can be modified if the
                        target is much larger or smaller than the
                        obstructions. This is left for the GM to
                        decide, but if two humans are fighting a 20m
                        long dragon, then it is suggested that no
                        penalty is applied.

                    <para>
                        A fumble in this situation means that a random
                        target is hit. It is possible to hit the 'right'
                        random target. Chance of hitting each target
                        should be based on size, and ideally distance from
                        the intended target. In reality, just assigning
                        equal chance to everyone is good enough.

                        how bad a shot it is. In all cases, a luck point
                        can be spent before hand to negate, or at
                        least reduce, the chance of hitting a friend.

                    Instead of making a normal attack, before initiative
                    is determined, a character can opt to make one special
                    attack. Unless noted otherwise, these are available to
                    all forms of attack, and all types of weapons. In some
                    cases, special attacks can be combined, but only if it

                    If two actions are combined, and both modify the

                    example, aiming allows a fast attack the following
                    round, and can be combined with killing blow, which
                    is a slow attack. A round is spent aiming, then the
                    following round a slow killing blow attack is made.

                        occurs as a fast attack the following round. This

                        to the attack, but the total soak of the target
                        is halved. Furthermore, the attack counts
                        as a <e>killing blow</e>. An
                        ambusher cannot defend during the round, and

                        This is a melee attack, which can be perform with
                        a melee weapon against a melee weapon. It cannot
                        be used against shields, and suffers -10 against
                        a weapon which is being used two handed. A weapon
                        attack roll is made at -10, versus the defence
                        roll as per normal (though no defence penalty is
                        suffered from fighting multiple opponents for this
                        roll only). On success, the defender is off
                        balance and looses attack and defence bonuses
                        from that weapon for the rest of the round (it is
                        possible that this has no effect). A second
                        oppossed roll is made, with the dexterity of the
                        attack and defender. If the attack equals or
                        exceeds the defender, then the defender has been
                        disarmed.

                        categories of damage are caused, the target is
                        instantly killed. If performed with a weapon doing

                <para>
                    Counter strikes are secondary attacks made against
                    an attacker as part of a defence. They represent
                    punches, kicks, shield bashes and similar actions
                    that occur as part of a melee - effectively 'dirty
                    fighting'.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A counter strike is a free action that does not need
                    to be declared before hand. However, two requirements
                    must be met in order for a counter strike to be made.
                    The first is that the character must have already
                    acted this round (i.e. it must be after their
                    initiative), and secondly, they must have made a
                    successful defence against an attacker by at least
                    ten points. If these two requirements have been met,
                    then a counter strike may be made against the
                    attacker (for a counter strike, the strike is made
                    by the defender against the attacker).
                </para>

                <para>
                    The defender (the character making the counter strike)
                    makes a brawling attack, with penalties equal to those
                    they had for the defence roll (including those for
                    defending against multiple opponents). The attacker
                    makes a brawl defence roll, and if he succeeds, then
                    the counter strike fails. Note that the brawl defence
                    suffers penalties for performing multiple defences,
                    i.e. if the attacker was already defending against two
                    people, then his defence would be at -10. The brawl
                    defence is considered a 'free' defence, but does suffer
                    the penalties for other defences.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A successful counter strike results in a brawling
                    (stun) damage roll. The counter striker may use the
                    damage bonus of their weapon or shield (depending on
                    where the initial attack came from), though the
                    damage is always considered to be stun damage.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the counter striker is attacking aggresively,
                    or is in a berserk rage, or performing any similar
                    action which gives a penalty to defence rolls, then
                    this penalty does not apply to the counter strike.
                    However, the attack bonus is not gained for the
                    counter strike attack either.

                    Berserkers are mad warriors who show little concern
                    for their own survival. Fueled up on bloodlust,
                    religious fervour or drugs, they are able to shrug
                    aside injuries, and fight with a strength and

                        due to range are also doubled.

                        Missile combat however suffers no penalty if the
                        horse is stationary. No roll is required to stay
                        mounted, and range penalties are not doubled.

                        A <e>mounted charge</e> is a special kind of attack
                        that uses a lance from horseback, and can only be
                        used after at least a full round of charging. This
                        can only be done from a trained warhorse.

                        On a successful mounted attack, damage is done with

                        of any bonuses due to the <e>ride</e> skill).
                        Furthermore, for each wound dealt, a stun is dealt
                        as well from the shock of the attack.

                    Use of poison is often frowned upon by honourable
                    warriors, but not everyone is honourable, and not
                    everyone is a warrior willing to stand up in a
                    toe-to-toe fight. Poison may be used on darts, put
                    in food, or put on bladed weapons. Different types
                    of poisons have varying effectiveness, though very
                    few will give instant death.

                    <para>
                        Any poison may be resisted by making a resistence
                        roll. This is normally stamina x size of the
                        intended victim.

                    <para>
                        Poison can take a varying amount of time to take
                        affect. This may be a round, a minute, 15 minutes,
                        a day or any other period of time. When a poison is
                        first administered, a resistence roll is not made,
                        instead the roll is made after the given period of
                        time has passed. Even deadly poisons will tend to
                        have times in the minutes.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The target difficulty of the resistence roll is the
                        strength of the poison. A good poison will tend to
                        have a strength in the 30 - 50 range. Whether the
                        resistence roll was successful or not, the poison
                        will continue to do damage to the victim. Once the
                        poison's effect time has passed again, then another
                        resistence roll is required, at a reduced difficulty.
                        Normally, the difficulty drops by 5 each time,
                        though this will be specified in the poison
                        description.

                    <para>
                        For example, a poison with a strength of 40, and a
                        time of 1 minute, would require a resistence roll
                        against 40 after one minute, against 35 after two
                        minutes, then 30 after three minutes etc. Once 0
                        or less has been reached, no further rolls are
                        required and the poison is considered to have
                        finished its work.

                        <para>
                            If a resistence roll was successful, then the
                            poison has no effect over that time period. If
                            it failed however, then the victim suffers
                            some effect from the poison. Poisons will have
                            a number of effects listed, in increasing order
                            of severity. For example, these might be
                            nausea, weakness, cramps, paralysis, death.
                            </para>

                        <para>
                            The first time the resistence is failed, the
                            first effect takes affect. The next failure
                            causes the next effect and so on. For the
                            above example, for a poison of strength 40,
                            most people are likely to suffer nausea,
                            weakness and cramps. Many people may suffer
                            paralysis, and a few would actually die (in
                            worst case, a stamina x size roll of 20 would
                            need to be failed in order to die).
