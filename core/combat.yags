            <para>
                This is a basic introduction to the <tm>Yags</tm>
                combat system, and a description of low tech fighting,
                using swords, bows and brawling. Modern day warfare
                is covered in <ref>Modern Combat</ref> and futuristic
                combat is covered in <ref>Future Combat</ref>.

                <para>
                    The following terms are used frequently within
                    these rules, so they are described up front. A
                    full description of how they are used will be
                    given later.
                </para>

                <termlist sort="true">
                    <entry term="Round">
                        A round is a unit of time, averaging
                        about five seconds. Each round, a
                        character has chance to perform a
                        single action - normally an attack or
                        a move. Five seconds is actually quite
                        a long time in a melee fight, so a fair
                        degree of latitude is allowed as regards
                        to what can be accomplished. However,
                        only a single attack may ever be made.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Body Levels">
                        Every creature has a number of body
                        levels, which represent their health.
                        Most creatures have a number of body
                        levels equal to their size plus two.
                        The extra two represent <s>OK</s>
                        and <s>Fatal</s> which are at
                        either extreme of a living creature's
                        state of health.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Soak">
                        Soak is how good a creature is at
                        resisting (soaking) damage. An adult
                        human will usually have a base soak of
                        12. Any armour worn adds to this.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Wounds">
                        Wounds are serious injuries which have
                        a good chance of causing death. They
                        often puncture the skin, resulting in
                        bleeding and possible the loss of vital
                        organs. A creature can suffer a number of wounds
                        equal to their body levels before dying.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Stuns">
                        Stuns are non-serious injuries which
                        result in bruises and pain. They will
                        rarely kill, but a severe beating can
                        in theory inflict enough stuns to kill
                        a person, since excessive stuns translate
                        into <s>wounds</s>. Once someone has stuns
                        equal to their body levels, they are practically
                        out of the fight.
                    </entry>
                    
                    <entry term="Fatigue">
                        Fatigue is a measure of how tired a creature is.
                        Unlike wounds and stuns, the amount of fatigue a
                        creature can handle is based on their stamina.
                        There are two types of fatigue - temporary and
                        permanent. Temporary fatigue is more common in
                        combat, and can be recovered with a short rest.
                        Permanent fatigue can only be recovered after a
                        good nights sleep, but is only gained through
                        sleep deprivation or after several hours of
                        physical effort.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Damage">
                        Damage is done when one creature hits
                        another. Often, damage induces wounds or
                        stuns in the target. An attack will
                        inflict either <term>wounds</term>,
                        <term>stuns</term> or <term>mixed</term>
                        damage which is split between stuns and
                        wounds. Many animals cause mixed damage
                        with claw and bite attacks.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Load">
                        A character's load is a measure of how
                        much they are carrying. Each weapon and
                        piece of armour has a load associated
                        with it. If the total load is greater
                        than the character's strength x 4, then
                        they are considered to be encumbered and
                        at penalty.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Special Attack">
                        A special attack is chosen before
                        initiative is determined, and can have
                        a modifier on how a character attacks,
                        and also on the results of the attack.
                        Individual special attacks are described
                        later, but include such things as killing
                        blow or aimed shot. They are very useful,
                        and players should be aware of their
                        options.

                <title>Fighting Styles</title>

                <para>
                    When a character or creature makes an attack,
                    they do so using one of a number of different
                    fighting styles. Each fighting style has its
                    own skill, and is independent of the weapon
                    being used.
                </para>

                <termlist>
                    <entry term="Brawling">
                        Brawling is the simplest style of fighting,
                        involving punching, kicking and grappling.
                        It also covers use of small weapons such
                        as a knife, dagger or broken bottle. Since
                        the skill of brawling is one of the eight
                        basic talents all people have, everyone has
                        some skill in it. Creatures generally use
                        brawling attacks.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Single weapon">
                        The single weapon fighting style involves using
                        a single one handed weapon to attack with. A
                        shield cannot be used. Most weapons, other than
                        shields and two handed weapons, can be used with
                        this style, and only a single skill (single weapon)
                        is needed to cover them all.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Weapon and shield">
                        This fighting style uses a combination of a one
                        handed weapon and a shield, to give what is
                        possibly the best combination. Any type of shield,
                        and any one handed weapon can be used with this
                        style.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Great weapon">
                        The great weapon style allows use of a single
                        weapon which requires two hands to use it. It
                        suffers from lack of defence, but such weapons
                        can be very good at cleaving through armour.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Two weapons">
                        This style of fighting involves the use of two one
                        handed weapons at once. Though this gives an edge
                        over only using one weapon, it does not grant two
                        attacks in a combat round. Further, it is
                        generally not as good as using a shield instead
                        of a second weapon, but it does have its advantages.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Longshaft weapon">
                        This style of fighting uses a single two handed
                        weapon such as a long spear, quarterstaff or
                        lance, or single handed versions of the same. A
                        shield may be used if the weapon is one handed.
                    </entry>
                    
                    <entry term="Flail weapon">
                        Flails are a small category of weapon which are
                        quite rare, consisting of a number of balls or
                        rods, attached via chain or leather to a haft.
                        They can be used with or without a shield. They
                        have the advantage that when used defensively,
                        the defence bonus is +10 (rather than +5). If
                        used aggresively, then the attack bonus is +10
                        (rather than +5). See the section on special
                        attacks for more information.

                <title>Combat Statistics</title>

                <para>
                    Each weapon has a number of statistics which
                    represents how effective it is. These give a bonus
                    to a character's skill checks in combat. All
                    bonuses are zero or positive - no weapon gives a
                    negative adjustment to combat actions.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Creatures which have natural attacks have their
                    own combat modifiers, depending on the nature of
                    their natural weapons. Generally, these are worse
                    than those of man made weapons. Size, reach and
                    sharpness all have a say in how effective natural
                    weapons are for a given type of creature.
                </para>

                <termlist>
                    <entry term="Initiative">
                        The initiative of a weapon represents how quickly
                        it can be brought to use. In a round, character's
                        with a high initiative act before those with lower
                        initiatives. Long weapons can grant a high
                        initiative since they provide a tactical advantage
                        for their user.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Attack">
                        The attack rating of a weapon gives a bonus to hit
                        a target. The attacker's attack skill is rolled
                        against the defender's defence skill.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Defence">
                        The defence rating of a weapon adds to a
                        characters parry or dodge attempts. Normally,
                        defence is dexterity based if the character is
                        using a melee weapon, or agility based if not.
                        The single weapon combat style allows the
                        character to choose whether to use agility or
                        dexterity for defence.
                    </entry>

                    <entry term="Damage">
                        The weapon damage adds to the strength of the
                        user, and is unaffected by skill.

            <title>Weapons</title>

            <para>
                There are a variety of different weapons, all with their
                own advantages and disadvantages. The table lists the
                most common weapons, together with the statistics which
                are required in combat.
            </para>

            <import-weaponlist href="../equipment/weapons.xml"/>

            <para>
                The four ability modifiers - initiative, attack, defence and
                damage add to the base ability for a character when they are
                using that weapon.
            </para>

            <para>
                The given strength is the minimum strength required to use the
                weapon effectively. If this strength is not met, then the
                character is at -5 to initiative, attack and defence per point
                below. If the weapon is being used two handed, then add 50%
                (round up) to the character's strength for this purpose only.
            </para>

            <para>
                The weapon's load is a measure of how heavy it is. The load of
                all weapons, armour and equipment being carried needs to be
                totalled, and compared to the character's strength, to see if
                they are encumbered. More on this later.

                    When engaging in combat, a character or creature
                    has five four main statistics which govern whether
                    the attack succeeds or fails. These are based on
                    the character's skill, with a modifier for the
                    weapon.

                    An axe for example has an initiative of +6. If
                    the character has a skill of 5 and an agility of
                    3, then their initiative is 5 &#215; 3 (15) + 6 = 21.

                        If a character is using a shield, then bonuses
                        from the shield are added to the bonuses of the
                        primary weapon. This can greatly bias combat in
                        favour of having a shield. Further, there are
                        other bonuses gained from using a shield when
                        fighting multiple opponents, which is described
                        later.

                    <para>
                        When fighting with two weapons, the weapon in
                        the off hand is the secondary weapon, and the
                        other weapon is considered the primary weapon.
                        Half the statistics (rounded down) of the
                        secondary weapon are added to those of the
                        primary weapon.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Since both weapons give a bonus to damage,
                        this style of fighting has one advantage over
                        using a shield (which generally doesn't give
                        any damage bonuses). However, defending with two
                        weapons isn't as easy as defending with a weapon
                        and shield.

                        The minimum strength requirement of the secondary
                        weapon is increased by two.

            <title>Melee Combat</title>

            <para>
                Strictly speaking, melee combat involves two or more
                characters fighting each other close up with melee
                weapons. The rules for melee combat form the basis
                of other forms of combat as well (such as ranged
                combat), so the basic rules of combat are
                described here.
            </para>

            <para>
                All combat is divided into rounds, and each round is
                broken into a number of different steps. Various book
                keeping activities happen at the end of each round.

                    <para>
                        The first step in each round involves
                        determining what each character or creature
                        is going to be doing. Since a round lasts
                        five seconds, there is generally time to move
                        as well as do something else, though a full
                        sprint will take up the entire round.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If a character is performing an attack, then
                        any special attacks must be declared at this
                        point, before initiative is determined.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Action determination is considered to be
                        simultaneous for everyone. If a character
                        wishes to 'wait' then they must declare what
                        they are waiting for, and what they will do
                        when it happens. Declarations such as
                        <e>I'll hit him if he moves</e>
                        are perfectly valid.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        It is not possible to wait until the end of
                        the round - any waiting must be for a particular
                        event. It is not possible to wait for a non
                        event. For example, an archer might specify
                        that they are waiting for someone to come
                        through a door, and that they will shoot them
                        when they do. If someone comes through the door,
                        then they get an attack, otherwise they perform
                        no action that round.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Further, a declaration to shoot someone if they
                        come through the door, otherwise shoot someone
                        else is not valid. The character will not know
                        that someone is not going to come through the
                        door until the round has ended, by which time
                        it is too late.

                        <title>Declaring Attacks</title>

                        <para>
                            Only one attack may be declared each round
                            by a character. The target of the attack
                            must be specified, as well as whether the
                            attack is a special attack of any kind.
                            Many characters may attack a single target
                            however, up to whatever is practical given
                            the size of the target. Assume that four
                            people can attack a man sized target, unless
                            circumstances dictate otherwise.

                        <para>
                            If attackers are armed with long weapons
                            such as spears, then up to six may attack
                            at once.

                        <para>
                            A character may defend against any number
                            of opponents, though there are penalties
                            if more than one defence is performed.
                            Since defences are being declared, it is
                            necessary for a character to know who is
                            attacking them that round.

                    <para>
                        Initiative determines who acts first, with
                        higher initiatives going before lower ones.
                        If the character is making an attack, then
                        their initiative depends on their initiative
                        derived from their weapon statistic. Most other
                        actions can be derived from their brawling
                        initiative (agility x brawl).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Some actions are considered to be either slow or
                        fast. Fast actions always come before other
                        actions, and slow actions always go after all
                        other actions. When resolving initiative, resolve
                        all fast actions first, then all normal actions,
                        then all slow actions. In a few circumstances,
                        an action may be very slow, in which case these
                        are resolved last. Use of some special attacks
                        will make an action slow or fast.
                    </para>
                    
                    <example>
                        <para>
                            Alice has an initiative of 28, Bob has an
                            initiative of 24 and Charles has an initiative
                            of 22. Alice and Bob make normal attacks, but
                            Charles makes an aggressive attack, which is
                            always fast. When actions are resolved, fast
                            actions go first, so Charles is first to act.
                            Next, normal actions are performed, so Alice
                            acts, followed by Bob.

                        <para>
                            If Alice's action was also an aggressive attack,
                            then she would be considered fast as well as
                            Charles. When fast actions are resolved, they
                            would be in order of Alice, then Charles. Bob
                            would then act last, taking only a normal speed
                            action.

                            If initiative is fumbled, by rolling a 1,
                            then two things occur. First, the character
                            acts in the next speed category down, so a
                            normal action becomes slow, and a slow action
                            becomes very slow.

                        <para>
                            Secondly, the person becomes fatigued, gaining
                            one level of temporary fatigue.

                            A reaction is in response to another's action.
                            Some special attack types are considered to
                            be reactions. In this case, the reacting
                            character acts immediately after the action
                            that they are reacting to.
                        </para>
                        
                        <para>
                            Normally, a reaction can only be used if the
                            character's action would normally occur before
                            the event. However, it is delayed until after

                        to not defend against all attacks, in order to
                        at least have a chance at defending against some
                        of them. It is not possible to defend against more

            <title>Damage and Wounds</title>

            <para>
                A successful attack can result in damage and/or death to
                the defender. Damage is represented as either wounds or
                stuns - the former being by far the most deadly. Most
                weapons cause wounds, whilst punching someone will cause
                stun damage. Stuns are temporary, and even the worst stun
                damage will be recovered in a few days.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some attacks will cause a mixture of stuns and wounds.
                Animal attacks are often of this kind.
            </para>

            <para>
                Damage is measured in levels, and is calculated from the
                damage roll of the attacker and the soak roll of the
                defender. Soak, which includes basic toughness plus
                protective armour, reduces damage suffered from an attack.
            </para>

            <para>
                To find the damage, roll the strength x 4 + weapon damage
                bonus of the attacker, and subtract the base soak + armour
                soak roll of the defender. A typical human has a base soak
                of 12. A full suite of chain armour gives a further +13
                soak, for a total of 25. A typical human with a strength
                of 3 and using a sword has a damage of 3 x 4 + 12 = 24.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the damage roll is higher than the soak roll, then
                damage of some kind has been caused. For every five points
                (or part thereof) higher, one level of injury is suffered
                by the target. The effects of these injury levels depends
                on the damage type of the weapon - wounds, stuns or split
                damage.

                <para>
                    Every creature has a <e>knockdown</e> score, which is
                    the amount of damage a creature can stand in one blow
                    and still remain standing. Knockdown calculation is
                    performed before armour and soak is subtracted from the
                    damage, so it is possible to knock someone to the floor,
                    even if you don't get through their armour.
                </para>
                
                <para>
                    The knockdown score for a person or creature is equal
                    to their <skillequation><attribute>strength</attribute>
                    <skill>10</skill><bonus>10</bonus></skillequation>
                    For an average human, this
                    is equal to 40. If a blow equals or exceeds this value,
                    then the creature receives one stun regardless of their
                    soak. They must then make an
                    <skillequation><attribute>agility</attribute>
                    <skill>brawl</skill></skillequation> roll to remain

                <para>
                    The brawl roll is at a target difficulty of 20 plus
                    the amount the damage was over the character's
                    knockdown.

                <para>
                    Wounds represent damage that has a good chance of
                    breaking the skin and affecting vital organs, or
                    causing massive bleeding or broken bones. Every
                    injury level causes one wound, and wounds are
                    cumulative from one attack to the next. If a person
                    takes two wounds from one attack, and three wounds
                    from a second attack the following round, they have
                    a total of five wounds.

                <para>
                    Unlike wounds, stuns are short term and generally
                    non-fatal. Stun damage is caused by attacks which
                    bruise or scratch such as fists, chair legs and
                    staffs. It is possible to kill someone with stun
                    damage, though it is unlikely.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Unlike wounds, stun damage is not cumulative. If a
                    character receives a number of stuns greater than
                    the stun levels they currently have, then they become
                    stunned to that level. The stuns are not added to
                    the stuns they already have.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a character receives at least one or more stuns
                    which do not exceed their current stun level, then
                    they gain one stun.

                <para>
                    Similar to wounds, a character suffers penalties
                    from being stunned. The penalties are on a similar
                    scale for wound penalties, and a character who is
                    both wounded and stunned suffers both sets of
                    penalties.

                <para>
                    Some weapons have a damage type of
                    <e>Mixed</e>, which causes both stun and
                    wound damage. On a scale of severity, it isn't as deadly
                    as wound damage, but is worse than stun damage.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Mixed damage is split equally between stuns and wounds,
                    with any remainder going on stuns (so one level of

                    All stuns from mixed damage are cumulative. If a
                    character receives three levels of mixed damage, he
                    suffers two stuns and one wound. If that character
                    already has two stuns and two wounds, he will now
                    have four stuns and three wounds.

                <para>
                    Fatigue is not strictly damage, but it is treated
                    in much the same way as damage is, so is described
                    here. Fatigue is gained due to strenuous exercise,
                    some mental/magical attacks or lack of sleep. Depending
                    on the magic system used, spell casting can also result
                    in fatigue being gained.
                </para>

                <para>
                    As for other types of <e>damage</e>,
                    fatigue is measured in levels, each level giving a
                    penalty to all actions. These levels range from 'OK'
                    to 'Exhausted'.
                </para>

                <para>
                    There are types of fatigue - temporary and permanent.
                    Unless stated otherwise, all fatigue gained is temporary
                    and can be lost with a short rest.
                </para>

                <para>
                    All fatigue is recorded on the same track. If a person
                    has two points of temporary fatigue and two points of
                    permanent fatigue, then for purposes of everything save
                    for recovery, they have four points of fatigue. For
                    someone with a stamina of 3, this would give them a
                    single -6 penalty, not two -1 penalties.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that fatigue is kept track of on the
                    character sheet by crossing off temporary fatigue levels
                    with a single line, and permanent fatigue with a cross.

            <title>Armour</title>

            <para>
                The purpose of armour is to keep someone alive by absorbing
                or deflecting the force of a blow away from them. In reality,
                the relationship between weapons and armour is complicated,
                having evolved during an arms race lasting several millennia.
                As a type of armour was developed to counter the weapons
                then in use, so the weapons changed to minimise the effects
                of the new armour.
            </para>

            <para>
                Realistically, it is not always possible to say that one
                type of armour is better at stopping damage than another
                type. The usefulness of armour depends on whether the
                attack crushes, slices or pierces, and there are
                complications within these as well. Yags however,
                deliberately ignores this. Armour has a single
                protection value which works equally against all types
                of armour.
            </para>

            <para>
                A further simplification is that there are no hit locations.
                The protection value of armour also takes into account how
                much of the body it covers. It is left to GMs to rule when
                an attack can avoid armour - generally this will only be
                possible against an unsuspecting foe.

            <sect2>
                <title>Choosing armour</title>

                <para>
                    A full set of armour can consist of several parts, and a
                    character can mix and match according to preference and
                    finances. Generally, armour cannot be layered - it is 
                    not possible to wear two chain hauberks at the same time.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each item of armour has a protection value, and a load.
                    The total load and protection of all worn items is
                    totalled to give the final value. So, a character
                    wearing soft leather trousers (with a protection of 2)
                    and a soft leather jacket (also 2), would have
                    a total armour protection of 4.

                    After a character has become injured, it may be
                    necessary for first aid to be applied to the wounds
                    in order for them to heal. Fresh wounds need to be
                    stabilised, a process which requires another
                    character to make an intelligence x first aid roll
                    on the wounded character.

                <para>
                    The base difficulty to successfully first aid a
                    character's stuns is zero. To tend to a character's
                    wounds, the base difficulty is 10. In both cases, the
                    difficulty is modified upwards by the character's
                    total stun and wound penalties.

                    For example, a battered (-6) and lightly wounded (-1)

                    stuns, and 17 to first aid their wounds.

                <para>
                    A character may first aid themselves - as long as they

                    penalties to their skill roll (as well as them adding

                        A successful first aid attempt against wounds will
                        stabalise the wound, preventing it from becoming
                        infected or worsening. If the roll was at least 10
                        points higher than the difficulty, then a single
                        wound level is immediately healed.

                        A character who is fatally wounded, does not have
                        to roll to see if they die while the first aid
                        attempt is in progress. However, if the first aid
                        fails (at the end of the minute it takes), then
                        the character has to start rolling again as per
                        normal.

                        infected and worsens. The character makes a stamina
                        roll at difficulty 20, modified by wound penalties.
                        Failure means that the wound is infected, and
                        worsens by one level. Each day thereafter, until
                        first aid is successfully attempted, another roll
                        is needed, with each failure worsening the wound
                        each time.

                        Success means that one stun level is healed, and each

                        If the character fumbles their stamina roll, then

                    <para>
                        The only way to recover from fatigue is through
                        rest. Temporary fatigue can be recovered in a
                        matter of minutes, whilst permanent fatigue can
                        only be recovered with a good sleep.

                    <para>
                        For each level of fatigue a person has, it takes
                        five minutes to recover one temporary level. If a
                        person has four levels of temporary fatigue, then
                        it takes 20 minutes of rest to loose the first level,
                        then 15 minutes for the next level, 10 minutes for
                        the third level and finally 5 minutes for the last
                        level.

                        Permanent fatigue counts towards temporary fatigue,
                        but can not be lost through simple rest. A person
                        with two permanent fatigue and two temporary, could
                        loose the temporary fatigue after 35 minutes, but
                        would need a night of rest to loose the rest.

                    <para>
                        Permanent fatigue is recovered after a night of

                        fatigue automatically, and one point of permanent

                        can be difficult to use.

                        both the minimum and maximum strength. A stronger 
                        bowman cannot use their full strength when

                        equivalent strength (due to long hours spent
                        exercising wrist and arm muscles). For every full
                        four points of skill a longbowman has, then they
                        get an effective +1 to their strength when using a

                        The range increment is a measure of how accurate the

                        each multiple of this distance gives a +5 modifier
                        to the target difficulty.

                        Weapons such as bows, crossbows, hurled weapons and
                        slings must be aimed on a ballistic trajectory to
                        hit targets at medium or long range. Targets at
                        short range can be hit on a more or less flat
                        trajectory. So, for example, it is not possible to
                        fire at long range down a low corridor.

                        At medium range, there must be ample height available

                        the range is needed in height. Firing a long bow at
                        a target 200m away, requires 100m of height, since
                        this is at long range.

                        can hit the window, but not someone behind the
                        window. At medium range, it is possible to hit
                        someone immediately behind a window or similar gap,
                        but it would not be possible to fire through a

                    <para>
                        One problem with missile weapons is that it is not
                        possible to parry with them. If the weapon has an
                        equivalent melee defence total, then use the defence
                        total for that (i.e. a thrown dagger is treated as
                        a melee dagger for defence), otherwise it
                        is not possible to parry with a missile weapon.
                        Instead, the character must perform a brawling
                        defence (agility x brawl), with no modifier for
                        the weapon being used.

                        they get the defence bonus of the shield, but not
                        of any other weapon they are using.

                    <para>
                        Firing into a melee combat is rarely a good idea,
                        but sometimes it is done anyway. If the target of
                        a missile attack is in close combat with anyone
                        else, then the fumble chance of the attack is
                        increased by two for each extra person. Firing
                        into a melee involving six people, would give a +10
                        to the fumble chance, meaning the attacker has a
                        chance of hitting the wrong target if the d20 rolls
                        less than 12.

                    <para>
                        The chance of fumbling can be modified if the
                        target is much larger or smaller than the
                        obstructions. This is left for the GM to
                        decide, but if two humans are fighting a 20m
                        long dragon, then it is suggested that no
                        penalty is applied.

                    <para>
                        A fumble in this situation means that a random
                        target is hit. It is possible to hit the 'right'
                        random target. Chance of hitting each target
                        should be based on size, and ideally distance from
                        the intended target. In reality, just assigning
                        equal chance to everyone is good enough.

                        how bad a shot it is. In all cases, a luck point
                        can be spent before hand to negate, or at
                        least reduce, the chance of hitting a friend.

                    Instead of making a normal attack, before initiative
                    is determined, a character can opt to make one special
                    attack. Unless noted otherwise, these are available to
                    all forms of attack, and all types of weapons. In some
                    cases, special attacks can be combined, but only if it

                    If two actions are combined, and both modify the

                    example, aiming allows a fast attack the following
                    round, and can be combined with killing blow, which
                    is a slow attack. A round is spent aiming, then the
                    following round a slow killing blow attack is made.

                        occurs as a fast attack the following round. This

                        to the attack, but the total soak of the target
                        is halved. Furthermore, the attack counts
                        as a <e>killing blow</e>. An
                        ambusher cannot defend during the round, and

                        be used against shields, and suffers -10 against
                        a weapon which is being used two handed. A weapon
                        attack roll is made at -10, versus the defence
                        roll as per normal (though no defence penalty is
                        suffered from fighting multiple opponents for this
                        roll only). On success, the defender is off

                        from that weapon for the rest of the round (it is

                        No attack is made this turn (but character can
                        defend as normal), and a +5 bonus to attack and
                        initiative is gained next turn, as long as the
                        same opponent is being fought. Only possible in
                        melee, and during the following round, any other
                        special attack can be used. Further, special
                        attacks which automatically go last,
                        instead act at normal initiative.

                        A killing blow is a slow attack, and the character
                        suffers a -10 penalty to the attack roll. If the
                        attack is successful, and at least two full
                        categories of damage are caused, the target is
                        instantly killed. If performed with a weapon doing
                        stun or mixed damage, the target is knocked out
                        instead.

                <para>
                    Counter strikes are secondary attacks made against
                    an attacker as part of a defence. They represent
                    punches, kicks, shield bashes and similar actions
                    that occur as part of a melee - effectively 'dirty
                    fighting'.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A counter strike is a free action that does not need
                    to be declared before hand. However, two requirements
                    must be met in order for a counter strike to be made.
                    The first is that the character must have already
                    acted this round (i.e. it must be after their
                    initiative), and secondly, they must have made a
                    successful defence against an attacker by at least
                    ten points. If these two requirements have been met,
                    then a counter strike may be made against the
                    attacker (for a counter strike, the strike is made
                    by the defender against the attacker).
                </para>

                <para>
                    The defender (the character making the counter strike)
                    makes a brawling attack, with penalties equal to those
                    they had for the defence roll (including those for
                    defending against multiple opponents). The attacker
                    makes a brawl defence roll, and if he succeeds, then
                    the counter strike fails. Note that the brawl defence
                    suffers penalties for performing multiple defences,
                    i.e. if the attacker was already defending against two
                    people, then his defence would be at -10. The brawl
                    defence is considered a 'free' defence, but does suffer
                    the penalties for other defences.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A successful counter strike results in a brawling
                    (stun) damage roll. The counter striker may use the
                    damage bonus of their weapon or shield (depending on
                    where the initial attack came from), though the
                    damage is always considered to be stun damage.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the counter striker is attacking aggresively,
                    or is in a berserk rage, or performing any similar
                    action which gives a penalty to defence rolls, then
                    this penalty does not apply to the counter strike.
                    However, the attack bonus is not gained for the
                    counter strike attack either.

                    Berserkers are mad warriors who show little concern
                    for their own survival. Fueled up on bloodlust,
                    religious fervour or drugs, they are able to shrug
                    aside injuries, and fight with a strength and
                    ferocity not normally possible.

                    Being a berserker is considered an advantage,

                        with experience. Being a berserker is a mind set
                        which is difficult to learn.

                        berserk, then they can do, and they gain all the

                            Failure means that they go berserk, getting any

                    Fighting from horse back can be tricky, but for a

                    has a riding skill less than four, then an agility 
                    based riding check is required whenever an
                    attack is made, against a target of 15. A rider
                    with a skill of four or more does not have to make

                    Failure of the riding roll means that the character

                    same difficulty to remain on the horse. If the rider
                    is not using saddle and stirrups, then both
                    difficulties are increased by 5.

                    being on higher ground etc are gained. The bonuses

                    few will give instant death.

                    <para>
                        Any poison may be resisted by making a resistence
                        roll. This is normally stamina x size of the
                        intended victim.

                    <para>
                        Poison can take a varying amount of time to take
                        affect. This may be a round, a minute, 15 minutes,
                        a day or any other period of time. When a poison is
                        first administered, a resistence roll is not made,
                        instead the roll is made after the given period of
                        time has passed. Even deadly poisons will tend to
                        have times in the minutes.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The target difficulty of the resistence roll is the
                        strength of the poison. A good poison will tend to
                        have a strength in the 30 - 50 range. Whether the
                        resistence roll was successful or not, the poison
                        will continue to do damage to the victim. Once the
                        poison's effect time has passed again, then another
                        resistence roll is required, at a reduced difficulty.
                        Normally, the difficulty drops by 5 each time,
                        though this will be specified in the poison
                        description.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        For example, a poison with a strength of 40, and a
                        time of 1 minute, would require a resistence roll
                        against 40 after one minute, against 35 after two
                        minutes, then 30 after three minutes etc. Once 0
                        or less has been reached, no further rolls are
                        required and the poison is considered to have
                        finished its work.

                        <para>
                            If a resistence roll was successful, then the
                            poison has no effect over that time period. If
                            it failed however, then the victim suffers
                            some effect from the poison. Poisons will have
                            a number of effects listed, in increasing order
                            of severity. For example, these might be
                            nausea, weakness, cramps, paralysis, death.
                            </para>

                        <para>
                            The first time the resistence is failed, the
                            first effect takes affect. The next failure
                            causes the next effect and so on. For the
                            above example, for a poison of strength 40,
                            most people are likely to suffer nausea,
                            weakness and cramps. Many people may suffer
                            paralysis, and a few would actually die (in
                            worst case, a stamina x size roll of 20 would
                            need to be failed in order to die).
