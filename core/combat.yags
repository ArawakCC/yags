            <para>
                This is a basic introduction to the <tm>Yags</tm>
                combat system, and a description of low tech fighting,
                using swords, bows and brawling. Modern day warfare
                is covered in <qv>Modern Combat</qv> and futuristic
                combat is covered in <qv>Future Combat</qv>.
            </para>

            <para>
                <note>It is assumed that the reader has read both the
                Introduction and the Character articles before reading

                <title>General Terminology</title>

                <para>
                    The following terms are used frequently within
                    these rules, so they are described up front. A
                    full description of how they are used will be
                    given later.
                </para>

                <itemlist order="sort">
                    <item name="Round">
                        A round is a unit of time, averaging about five
                        seconds. Each round, a character has chance to
                        perform a single action - normally an attack or a
                        move.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Body levels">
                        Every creature has a number of body levels, which
                        represent their ability to absorb damage. The number
                        of body levels determines how many wounds and stuns
                        a creature can take before it falls over.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Soak">
                        Soak is how good a creature is at
                        resisting (soaking) damage. An adult
                        human will usually have a base soak of
                        12. Any armour worn adds to this.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Wounds">
                        Wounds are serious injuries which have a good chance
                        of causing death. Most weapons cause wound damage.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Stuns">
                        Stuns are non-serious injuries which rarely kill,
                        being generally limited to stuns and bruises.
                        Excessive stun damage may lead to wounds however.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Mixed damage">
                        Mixed damage is half stuns, half wounds with odd
                        damage going on stuns. Many animals and light
                        bludgeoning weapons cause mixed damage.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Ineffective damage">
                        As stun damage, but the number of stuns applied is
                        halved (rounding down). Stun attacks may be reduced
                        to ineffective damage, but no attack does
                        ineffective as standard.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Fatigue">
                        Fatigue is a measure of how tired a creature is.
                        Unlike wounds and stuns, the amount of fatigue a
                        creature can handle is based on their stamina.
                        Fatigue can be recovered with a short rest.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Exhaustion">
                        Exhaustion is similar to fatigue, but can only be
                        recovered with sleep. It is gained from long term
                        physical activity such as hiking or heavy labour.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Damage">
                        Damage normally causes either stuns or wounds.
                        It is reduced by a creature's soak before being
                        applied.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Load">
                        A character can carry a load equal to the square of
                        their strength without penalty. Weapons, armour
                        and equipment carried add to load.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Technique">
                        A technique is a special action taken during an
                        attack, which either gives a bonus, or provides some
                        special effect. Techniques are considered to be
                        advantages, which must be learnt before they can be
                        used.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Stance">
                        Stance determines how a combatant is fighting, the
                        most common being normal, aggressive and defensive.
                        Prone and unsteady are two stances which a character
                        can be forced into.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Free strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent gets a free
                        defence roll, at the same penalty as other defence
                        rolls that round if multiple defenses have been
                        declared.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Automatic strike">
                        An extra attack which may be taken immediately
                        against a given opponent. The opponent does not get
                        a defence roll, so the attack is against the base
                        difficulty to hit the target.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Unsteady">
                        An unsteady combatant is one who is down on
                        their knees, or otherwise does not have secure
                        footing. It is a half way state between prone
                        and normal posture.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Prone">
                        A prone person is down on the floor, and
                        unable to act effectively. Attacks and defence are
                        possible from such a position, but they are at
                        penalty.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Grappled">
                        A grappled person is holding, or being held by,
                        another person. Neither can defend against attacks
                        made by others, nor can they attack anyone other than
                        the person they are grappling. All combat rolls are
                        made using the brawl skill. Penalties for
                        being prone do not apply between a grappled pair.
                    </item>

                    <item name="Combat bonuses">
                        The four statistics which define the bonuses a
                        weapon provides to skill and damage rolls in combat
                        (initiative, attack, defence and damage).

                <title>Fighting Styles</title>

                <para>
                    Every creature has a style of fighting, which determines
                    how they use their weapons. All combat using natural
                    weapons uses the <e>Brawling</e> style. Combat with
                    melee or missile weapons uses the style associated with
                    the type of weapon being used.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Each style is associated with a skill of the same name.
                    Only a single skill is needed to cover use of all weapons
                    which can be used with that style of fighting. It is
                    possible to use any melee weapon with any melee style,
                    though at a penalty.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If the weapon combination used is not applicable, the
                    combat bonuses of the weapon are halved. Further, all
                    attacks are slow, and all attack and defence rolls
                    fumble on a 1-2 rather than a 1 (unless brawl is being
                    used, in which case only fumble on a 1). No techniques
                    can be used. An aggressive stance will enable the
                    character to act with normal (not fast) initiative.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If using a second weapon, or a shield, only half the
                    defence bonus of the second weapon applies (all other
                    bonuses of the second weapon are ignored).
                </para>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Brawling</title>

                    <para>
                        Brawling is the simplest style of fighting,
                        involving punching, kicking and grappling. It also
                        covers the use of simple weapons such as a knife,
                        dagger or broken bottle.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        When using a brawling attack, the initiative,
                        attack, defence and damage bonuses of the weapon
                        (or the natural bonuses of the creature) add to
                        the combat rolls.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Unlike all the other weapon skills, the brawling
                        attack and defence are based on agility.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Single weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        A fighting style involving a single melee weapon,
                        such as a dagger, sword or mace. Most one handed
                        weapons can be used with this style.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The single weapon skill is based on dexterity,
                        though defence may be based on agility at the
                        option of the character.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Weapon and shield</title>

                    <para>
                        This fighting style uses a combination of a one
                        handed weapon and a shield, to give what is
                        possibly the best combination. Any type of shield,
                        and any one handed weapon can be used with this
                        style (anything which has a style of <e>single</e>
                        in other words).
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The full combat bonuses of the shield are added to
                        the combat bonuses of the primary weapon.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Great weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        The great weapon style allows use of a single
                        weapon which requires two hands to use it. It
                        suffers from lack of defence, but such weapons
                        can be very good at cleaving through armour.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Two weapons</title>

                    <para>
                        This style of fighting involves the use of two one
                        handed weapons at once. Though this gives an edge
                        over only using one weapon, it does not grant two
                        attacks in a combat round. Further, it is
                        generally not as good as using a shield instead
                        of a second weapon, but it does have its advantages.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Half the combat bonuses of the secondary weapon
                        (rounded up) are added to the die rolls. The minimum
                        strength requirement of the second weapon is also
                        increased by one.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Longshaft weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        This style of fighting uses a single two handed
                        weapon such as a long spear, quarterstaff or
                        lance, or single handed versions of the same. A
                        shield may be used if the weapon is one handed, as
                        if using the <e>Weapon and shield</e> style.
                    </para>
                </sect3>

                <sect3>
                    <title>Chain weapon</title>

                    <para>
                        Includes flails and other weapons consisting of
                        weights connected by a chain or rope to a haft.
                        They can be used with or without a shield. They
                        have the advantage that when used defensively,

                    Each weapon has a number of properties which
                    represents how effective it is. These give a bonus
                    to a character's skill checks in combat. All
                    bonuses are zero or positive - no weapon gives a
                    negative adjustment to combat actions.

                    Creatures which have natural attacks have their
                    own combat modifiers, depending on the nature of
                    their natural weapons. Generally, these are worse
                    than those of man made weapons. Size, reach and
                    sharpness all have a say in how effective natural
                    weapons are for a given type of creature.

                            initiative is represented by acting first in

                            weapon is at keeping the enemy away from the

                            includes the type of damage done - either stun,

                            be effectively used. Reach gives an advantage
                            against shorter weapons, though can be difficult

                            armour, heavy weapons use the 'half armour'

                            Against impaling weapons, such armour only

                        The <e>Reach</e> of a weapon is a measure of its
                        length and effectiveness at engaging targets at a
                        distance. Spears are the best reach weapons, knives

                        Weapons up to reach one require little or no space

                        reach, if they are to be swung effectively.
                        Thrusting weapons may need space behind them.

                            If a group of warriors are fighting in two or
                            more ranks, than it is possible for people in
                            the second rank to attack through the first
                            rank against the enemy if they have weapons
                            with sufficient reach.

                        <para>
                            The reach of the weapon is reduced by two plus
                            the reach of the target's weapon. If it is
                            zero or greater, then the second rank may also
                            strike at the target with thrusting weapons.
                            Any such attack is always slow, and counts as
                            coming from the first rank character (i.e.,
                            the target does not need to defend against two
                            opponents). The second rank can only use the
                            normal stance.

                            An attacker who does not have any real weapons
                            is at a disadvantage against a defender with a
                            real weapon. A real weapon is anything which
                            does more than <e>stun</e> damage, or has a
                            reach greater than zero and isn't part of the

                            with a sword, then an <e>good defence</e>
                            results in an <e>automatic strike</e> against

                            (i.e. a punch against anyone with a short sword
                            or longer), then only a <e>moderate defence</e>
                            is required in order to get an <e>automatic

            <para>
                Strictly speaking, melee combat involves two or more
                characters fighting each other close up with melee
                weapons. The rules for melee combat form the basis
                of other forms of combat as well (such as ranged
                combat), so the basic rules of combat are
                described here.

                            moving) and also loose their first defence.

                            fatigue (but can attack and defend as normal).
                            The fatigue is gained at the end of the round.

                    <para>
                        At the start of each round, all combatants declare
                        their actions simultaneously. Since a round is five
                        seconds, there is generally time to notice what
                        everyone else is doing before committing. If someone
                        takes a long time deciding on their action however,
                        then they loose it for that round.

                    <para>
                        If a character is performing an attack, then stance
                        and techniques should be declared at this point.
                        Once all attacks have been declared, characters can
                        declare how many attacks they are defending
                        against. It is not necessary to declare exactly
                        which attacks are being defended against.

                    <para>
                        Action determination is considered to be
                        simultaneous for everyone. If a character
                        wishes to 'wait' then they must declare what
                        they are waiting for, and what they will do
                        when it happens. Declarations such as
                        <e>I'll hit him if he moves</e>
                        are perfectly valid. If he hasn't moved by the end
                        of the round however, then the character does not
                        get any action.

                            A character's stance is considered to be
                            <e>normal</e> unless stated otherwise. Stance
                            determines what actions and techniques are
                            possible. Sometimes, stance is determined before
                            hand due to circumstances - a character who has
                            been knocked to the floor is considered to be
                            <e>prone</e>, regardless of what they wish to do
                            themselves.

                            A character may defend against any number

                            Since defenses are being declared, it is
                            necessary for a character to know who is
                            attacking them that round, so defenses are
                            declared after all attacks.

                <para>
                    If a character chooses to make an attack on someone,
                    then the target can choose either to defend
                    themselves or not. A character is limited to the
                    number of attackers they can defend against in a
                    round (the number is declared at the start of the
                    round), so there can be a reason to save a defence
                    for a more potent foe.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Unless the target is unaware of the attack (or
                    unable to respond in any meaningful way, such as
                    being tied up or using the <e>focused</e> stance),
                    the attacker must declare a defence against the
                    target. Failing to do so means that the target may
                    get a free strike against the attacker immediately
                    following the attack, assuming that the target is
                    still standing. This defence declaration must be
                    made before the attack, and cannot be left until
                    afterwards when the free strike is made (making
                    the free strike effectively an automatic strike in
                    most cases).

                        A defender who is having to defend against multiple
                        opponents will be at a penalty to all their defence
                        rolls. Defence is per opponent, not per attack, so
                        a single attacker making multiple attacks only
                        counts as a single source of attack.

                    <para>

                        their skill. This is the average of their

            <title>Damage and Wounds</title>

            <para>
                A successful attack can result in damage and/or death to
                the defender. Damage is represented as either wounds or
                stuns - the former being by far the most deadly. Most
                weapons cause wounds, whilst punching someone will cause
                stun damage. Stuns are temporary, and even the worst stun
                damage will be recovered in a few days.
            </para>

            <para>
                Some attacks will cause a mixture of stuns and wounds.
                Animal attacks are often of this kind.
            </para>

            <para>
                Damage is measured in levels, and is calculated from the
                damage roll of the attacker and the soak roll of the
                defender. Soak, which includes basic toughness plus
                protective armour, reduces damage suffered from an attack.
            </para>

            <para>
                To find the damage, roll the strength x 4 + weapon damage
                bonus of the attacker, and subtract the base soak + armour
                soak roll of the defender. A typical human has a base soak
                of 12. A full suite of chain armour gives a further +13
                soak, for a total of 25. A typical human with a strength
                of 3 and using a sword has a damage of 3 x 4 + 12 = 24.
            </para>

            <para>
                If the damage roll is higher than the soak roll, then
                damage of some kind has been caused. For every five points
                (or part thereof) higher, one level of injury is suffered
                by the target. The effects of these injury levels depends
                on the damage type of the weapon - wounds, stuns or mixed
                damage.
            </para>

                <title>Knockdown</title>

                <para>
                    Every creature has a <e>knockdown</e> score, which is
                    the amount of damage a creature can suffer in one blow
                    and still remain standing. Knockdown calculation is
                    performed before armour and soak is subtracted from the
                    damage, so it is possible to knock someone to the floor,
                    even if you don't get through their armour.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The knockdown score for a character is 2 x size x
                    strength + 10. For an average human, this is 40.
                    If a single blow equals or exceeds this value, then
                    they suffer one stun, and are considered immediately
                    <e>unsteady</e>.

                <para>
                    An agility brawl roll is then required, otherwise they
                    are immediately prone. The brawl roll is at a target
                    difficulty of 20 plus the amount the damage was over
                    the character's knockdown.

                <para>
                    Wounds represent damage that has a good chance of
                    breaking the skin and affecting vital organs, or
                    causing massive bleeding or broken bones. Every
                    injury level causes one wound, and wounds are
                    cumulative from one attack to the next. If a person
                    takes two wounds from one attack, and three wounds
                    from a second attack the following round, they have
                    a total of five wounds.

                            they will become fatally wounded, and need
                            to make a stamina roll at difficulty 30 to
                            remain alive, and 40 to remain conscious.

                <para>
                    Unlike wounds, stuns are short term and generally
                    non-fatal. Stun damage is caused by attacks which
                    bruise or scratch such as fists, chair legs and
                    staffs. It is possible to kill someone with stun
                    damage, though it is unlikely.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Unlike wounds, stun damage is not cumulative. If a
                    character receives a number of stuns greater than
                    the stun levels they currently have, then they become
                    stunned to that level. The stuns are not added to
                    the stuns they already have.
                </para>

                <para>
                    If a character receives at least one or more stuns
                    which do not exceed their current stun level, but are
                    at least half their current number of stuns, then
                    they gain one stun.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Similar to wounds, a character suffers penalties
                    from being stunned. The penalties are on a similar
                    scale for wound penalties, and a character who is
                    both wounded and stunned suffers both sets of
                    penalties.

                <para>
                    Some weapons have a damage type of
                    <e>Mixed</e>, which causes both stun and
                    wound damage. On a scale of severity, it isn't as deadly
                    as wound damage, but is worse than stun damage.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Mixed damage is split equally between stuns and wounds,

                    suffers two stuns and one wound. If that character

                    have four stuns and three wounds.

                <title>Fatigue</title>

                <para>
                    A character's fatigue is measured in a similar way to
                    wounds, though the number of fatigue levels they have
                    is based on their stamina, ranging from OK to
                    Exhausted. If a character becomes Exhausted then they
                    must immediately rest.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Fatigue is normally short term, and can be lost in
                    minutes. Exhaustion is gained through long term
                    effort or lack of sleep, and can only be lost through
                    a night of sleep. Exhaustion and fatigue stack
                    together on the same track - two levels of
                    fatigue and two levels of exhaustion add up to
                    four levels on the fatigue track, and count as a
                    single penalty as if the character had four levels
                    of either.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that fatigue is kept track of on the
                    character sheet by crossing off fatigue levels
                    with a single line, and exhaustion with a cross.
                    Exhaustion is always <e>first</e> on the line,
                    and last to be lost.

                There are no hit locations, so the protection given by

                    As for weapons, different types of armour may have
                    special properties. Unlike weapons, there are two
                    properties which all armour types are one of - whether
                    they are <e>heavy</e> or <e>light</e>.

                <para>
                    A whole suit of armour is considered to be either heavy
                    or light, even if the suit consists of some heavy and
                    some light components. By default, armour is light.
                    If heavy armour covers either the torso and arms, or
                    the torso and legs, then the whole suit of armour is
                    considered heavy.

                    A full set of armour can consist of several parts, and a
                    character can mix and match according to preference and
                    finances. Unless otherwise stated, armour cannot be
                    layered - it is not possible to wear two chain hauberks

                <para>
                    Each item of armour has a protection value, and a load.
                    The total load and protection of all worn items is
                    totalled to give the final value. So, a character
                    wearing soft leather trousers (with a protection of 2)
                    and a soft leather jacket (also 2), would have

                        Normally, it is not possible to layer armour on top
                        of other armour - if it is managed, only the highest
                        protection value is applied. However, some types of
                        armour are designed to layer, and in this case the
                        protection values are added together.

                        and breastplates can be worn over chain armour. It

                <para>
                    After a character has become injured, it may be
                    necessary for first aid to be applied to the wounds
                    in order for them to heal. Fresh wounds need to be
                    stabilised, a process which requires another
                    character to make an intelligence x first aid roll
                    on the wounded character.
                </para>

                <para>
                    The base difficulty to successfully first aid a
                    character's stuns is zero. To tend to a character's
                    wounds, the base difficulty is 10. In both cases, the
                    difficulty is modified upwards by the character's
                    total stun and wound penalties.
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, a battered (-6) and lightly wounded (-1)
                    character would be difficulty 7 to first aid their
                    stuns, and 17 to first aid their wounds.
                </para>

                <para>
                    A character may first aid themselves - as long as they
                    are conscious - but they suffer all their wound
                    penalties to their skill roll (as well as them adding
                    to the difficulty of the task).

                        Stuns do not need to be stabalised, so there is no
                        penalty from failing to have first aid performed as
                        long as the character is only stunned.

                        A successful first aid attempt against wounds will
                        stabalise the wound, preventing it from becoming
                        infected or worsening. If the roll was at least 10
                        points higher than the difficulty, then a single
                        wound level is immediately healed.

                    <para>
                        A character who is fatally wounded, does not have
                        to roll to see if they die while the first aid
                        attempt is in progress. However, if the first aid
                        fails (at the end of the minute it takes), then
                        the character has to start rolling again as per
                        normal.

                    <para>
                        If a wound is not successfully first aided within
                        an hour, then there is a chance that it becomes
                        infected and worsens. The character makes a stamina
                        roll at difficulty 20, modified by wound penalties.
                        Failure means that the wound is infected, and
                        worsens by one level. Each day thereafter, until
                        first aid is successfully attempted, another roll
                        is needed, with each failure worsening the wound
                        each time.

                        modified by their current wound and stun penalties.
                        Success means that one stun level is healed, and each

                        If the character fumbles their stamina roll, then

                        The bow, including both the longbow and shortbow,
                        requires this skill. The bow can be quite a deadly
                        weapon in the hands of a skilled professional, but
                        can be difficult to use.

                        Both longbows and shortbows are constructed for a
                        given strength of user. A bow's strength rating is
                        both the minimum and maximum strength. A stronger
                        bowman cannot use their full strength when
                        using the weapon.

                        A single attack action consists of loading, aiming
                        and firing the bow. This is considered to be a
                        slow action. If the bow was already loaded in a
                        previous round, then an attack action occurs on
                        a normal initiative. If the bow was loaded and
                        aimed in the previous round, then firing it is
                        considered a <e>fast</e> action.

                        Crossbows have their own skill. They are easier
                        to use for the unskilled user, but don't have the
                        accuracy at long range compared with the long bow.

                        Loading and firing a crossbow in a single round is

                        to load the crossbow. An attack may be made in the

                    As for melee combat, there is a base difficulty needed
                    to hit a target. Unlike in melee combat though, this is
                    modified by the range to the target, and environmental
                    factors such as wind and visibility.

                    For a human sized target, the base difficulty is 15, as

                    difficulty changes however.

                        The range increment is a measure of how accurate the

                        each multiple of this distance gives a +5 modifier
                        to the target difficulty.

                        Weapons such as bows, crossbows, hurled weapons and

                        hit targets at medium or long range. Targets at
                        short range can be hit on a more or less flat
                        trajectory. So, for example, it is not possible to
                        fire at long range down a low corridor.

                        the range is needed in height. Firing a long bow at
                        a target 200m away, requires 50m of height, since
                        this is at long range.

                        can hit the window, but not someone behind the

                        but it would not be possible to fire through a

                    <para>
                        One problem with missile weapons is that it is not
                        possible to parry with them. If the weapon has an
                        equivalent melee defence total, then use the defence
                        total for that (i.e. a thrown dagger is treated as
                        a melee dagger for defence), otherwise it
                        is not possible to parry with a missile weapon.
                        Instead, the character must perform a brawling
                        defence (agility x brawl), with no modifier for
                        the weapon being used.

                        Missile attacks can be dodged, but not parried
                        unless the defender has a shield, in which case
                        they get the defence bonus of the shield, but not
                        of any other weapon they are using.

                        The main issue with defending against missile
                        attacks is that the defender must be aware that
                        they are being made. If a character is in the
                        middle of a melee, then an awareness roll may be
                        required to notice an archer taking aim.

                    <para>
                        Firing into a melee combat is rarely a good idea,
                        but sometimes it is done anyway. If the target of
                        a missile attack is in close combat with anyone
                        else, then the fumble chance of the attack is
                        increased by two for each extra person. Firing
                        into a melee involving six people, would give a +10
                        to the fumble chance, meaning the attacker has a
                        chance of hitting the wrong target if the d20 rolls
                        less than 12.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The chance of fumbling can be modified if the
                        target is much larger or smaller than the
                        obstructions. This is left for the GM to
                        decide, but if two humans are fighting a 20m
                        long dragon, then it is suggested that no
                        penalty is applied.

                        A fumble in this situation means that a random
                        target is hit. It is possible to hit the 'right'
                        random target. Chance of hitting each target
                        should be based on size, and ideally distance from
                        the intended target. In reality, just assigning
                        equal chance to everyone is good enough.

                        If someone is wrestling with the intended target,
                        add +5 to +15 to the fumble chance, depending on
                        how bad a shot it is. In all cases, a luck point
                        can be spent before hand to negate, or at
                        least reduce, the chance of hitting a friend.

                    Fighting from horse back can be tricky, but for a
                    skilled rider it can be a big advantage. Warriors who
                    wish to fight from horseback should look at the
                    <e>mounted combat</e> and <e>mounted archery</e>

                    If a character wishes to make a melee attack from the
                    back of a mount, then they must make a agility riding
                    check at difficulty 15. One roll is required each round
                    that the character has declared any attacks or
                    defenses.

                    Failure of the riding roll means that the character
                    becomes unstable and looses their attack. A second roll
                    at the same difficulty to remain on the horse. If the
                    rider is not using saddle and stirrups, then both
                    difficulties are increased by 5.
