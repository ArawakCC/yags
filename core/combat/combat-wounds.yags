            <title>Damage, Stuns and Wounds</title>

            <para>
                Damage can take many forms, but it all comes down to one
                of the three types - either <e>wounds</e>, <e>stuns</e> or
                <e>mixed</e>. Related to damage is <e>fatigue</e> and
                <e>exhaustion</e>.
            </para>

            <sect2>
                <title>Fatigue</title>

                <para>
                    A character's fatigue is measured in a similar way to
                    wounds, though the number of fatigue levels they have
                    is based on their health, ranging from OK to
                    Exhausted. If a character becomes Exhausted then they
                    must immediately rest.
                </para>

                <para>
                    Fatigue is normally short term, and can be lost in
                    minutes. Exhaustion is gained through long term
                    effort or lack of sleep, and can only be lost through
                    a night of sleep. Exhaustion and fatigue stack
                    together on the same track - two levels of
                    fatigue and two levels of exhaustion add up to
                    four levels on the fatigue track, and count as a
                    single penalty as if the character had four levels
                    of either.
                </para>

                <para>
                    It is suggested that fatigue is kept track of on the
                    character sheet by crossing off fatigue levels
                    with a single line, and exhaustion with a cross.
                    Exhaustion is always <e>first</e> on the line,
                    and last to be lost.

                    <para>
                        <e>Explosive</e> damage tends to affect all targets
                        within an area, with less damage being caused to
                        targets at the edge than near ground zero. When
                        weapons cause explosive effects, they are listed as
                        <s>Ex-X</s>, where <s>X</s> is the base radius of
                        the explosion in metres.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Out to the base radius, targets receive the full
                        force of the explosion, and suffer <e>wounds</e>.
                        Out to twice the radius, targets receive only
                        mixed damage (but the damage rating is itself
                        unchanged) and out to triple the radius
                        <e>stuns</e> are caused.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        An explosion which does less than <e>wounds</e> will
                        have a similar drop in damage types, but may do no
                        damage at x2 or x3 ranges.
                    </para>

                    <sect4>
                        <title>Very large explosions</title>

                        <para>
                            If the explosion is particularly large, then
                            even at triple radius the <e>stun</e> damage can
                            be enough to kill someone. If the damage is
                            still noticeable, then extend it out to four
                            times the radius, but reduce the number of
                            stuns caused by a factor of five (round down).
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            For each extension of the range, drop the number
                            of stuns caused by another factor of five.
                        </para>

                                An bomb does +100 damage at Ex-10. The damage
                                rolled is 113, and a character rolls a soak
                                of 21. The damage applied is 92, or 19 levels
                                of damage.

                                Out to 10m, he would receive 19 wounds - an
                                immediate kill for pretty much anyone. Out to
                                20m, he would still receive 10 stuns and 9
                                wounds, again pretty certain death (4 of the
                                stuns would go 'off the scale', and wrap onto
                                wounds, giving a total of 13 wounds).

                                If he was within 30m, he would receive 19
                                stuns (which again wraps to 13 wounds).

                                down).

                            So, you've just dropped a 4000lb bomb on someone,
                            and want to know how much damage it does. The
                            simple answer is a lot. In most cases, the result
                            is an instant (messy) death.

                            If they're in a tank, or it's not a direct hit,
                            then it gets a bit more tricky. As a rough guide,
                            assume the following conversion for basic
                            explosives.

                            A single pound of TNT (since pounds is what TNT
                            is normally measured in) does +50 damage Ex-2.
                            Each doubling of the amount of explosive does an
                            extra +10 damage. Each ten fold increase in amount
                            of explosive doubles the radius.

                    Surviving the battle isn't always enough, and many
                    more people may die of their wounds after a battle
                    than during it - especially if there is no access to

                        medical attention. Every minute if inactive, or
                        every <e>round</e> if active, you must make a
                        <t>health</t> check at a target of 20 or die.

                        Failure or fumble will cause your wounds to

                        a <t>health</t> check at a target of 20.
                        Failure means that the wound will worsen by
                        one level, then stabalise (so no further
                        checks are required). Success causes the wound
                        to stabalise naturally.

                <para>
                    It is generally a good idea to get your wounds tended
                    to by another. Tending a wound takes one minute, and
                    requires an <y:intelligence>First aid</y:intelligence>
                    check at a base target of 10. The target is modified by
                    the total of your <e>wound</e> and <e>stun</e>
                    penalties halved (round up).
                </para>

                <para>
                    For example, you have moderate (-10) wounds and
                    light (-5) stuns, so the first aid difficulty will
                    be 10 + (10 + 5)/2 = 18.
                </para>

                <para>
                    On success, the wounds are stabalised. On a <e>good</e>
                    success, one level of wounds is immediately healed.
                </para>

                <para>
                    <e>Stuns</e> can be first aided as well, except that
                    the base target is 0, with the same modifiers. On
                    success, one stun is healed, and each level of success
                    beyond that heals another stun.
                </para>

                <para>
                    You may first aid yourself, though since you suffer
                    your full penalties whilst trying to do so, it may
                    be much harder than having someone else do it.

                        Each morning, a <t>health</t> check is made at a
                        target of 0, modified by half the total wound and
                        stun penalties currently suffered. Each level of
                        success causes one level of stun to be healed.

                    <para>
                        Wounds heal naturally after a week. Each week, the
                        character gets a health roll at difficulty 20,
                        modified by their total stun and wound penalties.
                        On a success, a single level of wound is healed.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If the character fumbles their health roll, then
                        their injury worsens, and they gain an extra wound
                        level. A character who is already fatally wounded
                        will die.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        If the wounded individual is spending the time
                        resting, and they are being looked after by someone
                        who has the <e>first aid</e> skill (spending at
                        least an hour a day with them), then they receive

                    <para>
                        The only way to recover from fatigue is through
                        rest. For each level of fatigue or exhaustion a
                        character has, it takes five minutes to recover
                        one level of fatigue.

                    <para>
                        Exhaustion counts towards fatigue, but cannot be
                        lost through a few minutes of rest. Four hours of
                        good sleep with remove all fatigue and one point
                        of exhaustion for every two points of health
                        (rounded up, so 2 exhaustion is recovered by
                        someone with a health of 3 or 4).
