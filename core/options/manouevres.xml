            <para>
                This manouevre allows the attacker to disarm their foe,
                removing the defender's weapon from their hand. An attack
                is made at -10. Success means that the defender cannot
                attack with that weapon that round (if their action has
                already occured this round, then they suffer no penalty).
            </para>

            <para>
                The defender has the choice of oppossed strength or
                dexterity skill checks. If the attack wins, then the
                defender has been disarmed.

            <para>
                This manouevre is intended to force the defender off their

            <para>
                When initiated against someone who is not expecting an
                attack (any attack, so cannot be done against someone
                in combat, even if they are fighting someone else),
                then an <e>ambush</e> ignores all armour. If
                <e>Killing Blow</e> or <e>Deadly punch</e> is known,
                then they may be combined with the <e>ambush</e>.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Ambush</e> is a slow attack.

            <para>
                The attack can attack twice, each time at a -20
                penalty to skill. The first attack is fast, the
                second attack is slow, but both happen at the same
                initiative.
            </para>

            <para>
                This does not affect defence, but no other manouevre
                can be combined with this.

                The attack can attack three times, each time at a -40
                penalty to skill. The first attack is fast, the
                second attack is normal, and the third attack is slow.
