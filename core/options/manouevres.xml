                This manouevre allows the attacker to disarm their foe,
                removing the defender's weapon from their hand. An attack
                is made at -10. Success means that the defender cannot
                attack with that weapon that round (if their action has
                already occured this round, then they suffer no penalty).
            </para>

            <para>
                The defender has the choice of oppossed strength or
                dexterity skill checks. If the attack wins, then the
                defender has been disarmed.
