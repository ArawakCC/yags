            <para>
                Science covers basic scientific knowledge, logical reasoning
                and ballony detection. Most Western schools will teach
                <e>science</e> to some degree. The skill provides basic
                knowledge of the various sciences, an understanding of the
                philosophy of science, and the ability to tell the
                difference between a scientific theory and dodgy
                pseudo-science.

            <para>
                Mathematics is the knowledge of advanced mathematics.
                Simple arithmetic is considered to be basic intelligence.
                Mathematics covers geometry, algebra, set theory,
                probability and other branches of mathematics. Most
                children with a Western education will have some
                knowledge of Mathematics after leaving school, though
                it's likely to be only a couple of points.

                This is concerned with the study of stars and planets,
                their motions, positions and general behaviour. It does
                not provide full detail on their formation and physical
                makeup (that is left to <e>Astrophysics</e>).

            <para>
                Astrophysics deals with the makeup and behaviour of stars
                and planets from the point of view of physics. It is not
                concerned with particular stars (that is <e>Astronomy</e>)
                but with the underlaying physics behind them.
