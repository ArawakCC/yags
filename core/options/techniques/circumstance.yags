    <advantage name="Stealthy in armour" type="technique">
        <cost points="3"/>
        <skill name="Stealth"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character is experienced with moving quietly whilst
                wearing armour. Agility penalty for moving quietly in
                armour is reduced by one. Automatic.

    <advantage name="Athletic in armour" type="technique">
        <cost points="4"/>
        <skill name="Athletics"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character is experienced with moving whilst wearing
                heavy armour. The total agility penalty caused by some

    <advantage name="Improved load" type="technique">
        <cost points="4"/>
        <skill name="Brawl, Athletics"/>

        <description>
            <para>
                Automatic. All encumbrance penalties are shifted down
                by one category, so a character can carry up to twice
                the square of their strength without penalty. If a
                character becomes overburdened however, they are still
                overburdened and this technique has no effect.
            </para>

            <para>
                Often taken by those who have trained fighting or
                hiking with heavy loads, such as armour, supplies and
                so forth.
