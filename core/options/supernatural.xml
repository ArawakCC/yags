            You are sensitive to that which is 'not quite right', or
            of a spiritual nature. You are often not aware that what
            you can sense, other's cannot - you cannot obviously tell
            what is natural and what isn't.

            Either from birth, or because of some event in your
            youth, your life is plagued by the interventions of dark
            powers, be they demons, fey or gods. Alternatively, it
            may have been prophesied that such will come about later
            in your life.
