    <skill name="Area lore" type="knowledge">
        <description>
            <para>
                Knowledge of a given area, including geographical and
                political knowledge. The <e>Area lore</e> skill is used
                when checking to see if a character has heard of a person,
                place or organisation. Area lore is nearly always based on
                intelligence.
            </para>

            <para>
                There is an area lore skill for each area. The size of
                the area covered can vary greatly, from a single village
                to a whole world. A skill which covers a large area will
                be less detailed than one covering a small area. Size of
                areas can be a <e>village</e>, a <e>hundred</e>,
                <e>shire</e>, <e>country</e>, <e>region</e>, <e>continent</e>
                or <e>world</e>.
            </para>

            <para>
                An item of knowledge at a given level may be known at
                higher levels, but the target number doubles at each
                increment. An area lore (village) at target 10 might
                tell you the name of the village's blacksmith, but
                the target would be 20 for area lore (hundred) and
                40 for area lore (shire). Very specific knowledge about
                small areas will generally only be known if the right
                specific area lore skill is known.
            </para>

            <para>
                The area lore that a character starts with will generally
                be based on either a village or hundred, unless they are
                well travelled.

    <!-- Chirurgury -->
    <skill name="Chirurgury" type="knowledge">
        <description>
            <para>
                Performing major operations on a wounded person. This
                requires some specialist tools (though rarely more complicated
                than sharp knives and tongs).
            </para>

    </skill>

    <!-- First aid -->
    <skill name="First aid" type="knowledge">
        <description>
            <para>
                Care and treatment of wounds to the extent of stopping
                bleeding, and preventing infection. General first aid
                checks are made with intelligence, though some tasks,
                such as removing an arrow from a wound, use dexterity.
            </para>

            <para>
                A first aid check may be made after someone has become
                injured, though only one first aid roll is allowed for
                a single set of injuries. A new first aid roll cannot
                be made until the subject has received more injuries.
            </para>

            <para>
                A successful first aid check will stabalise a wound and
                allow it to begin healing naturally. Failure to perform
                first aid on a subject means that nightly healing rolls
                are not possible, and weekly checks are at +10 to the
                target difficulty.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                If the subject is both stunned and wounded, seperate
                first aid rolls are required. If the first aid check is
                10 or more points above the target required, then one
                level of stun or wound is also healed immediately. A
                character may try to first aid themselves, though they
                suffer all the normal penalties for being injured.
