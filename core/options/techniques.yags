    <advantage name="Grapple" type="technique">

        <skill name="Brawl"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                A brawl attack is made at a -5 penalty in order to grab
                the defender (no damage is done). The defender can
                immediately try to break free, by forcing an opposed
                strength/brawl check, though the defender has the option
                of using their agility instead of strength.
            </para>

            <para>
                Whilst characters are grappling, neither can move, and both
                suffer a -10 penalty per point of reach of any weapon that
                is used. Neither can use a shield, and they can only
                defend against each other's attacks. Both can attack each
                other freely, or try to break the grapple as above.

    <advantage name="Trip" type="technique">
        <cost points="0"/>
        <skill name="Brawl"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                A brawling attack is made at -10, success means that a
                damage roll is made, plus there is a chance that the
                defender is knocked from their feet. The attacker makes
                a second brawl attack immediately, using strength
                instead of agility. The defender defends with either
                strength or agility, and uses either athletics or brawl
                to try and remain standing.
            </para>

            <para>
                Success on the part of the attacker means that the
                defender is <e>unsteady</e>. A good success means that
                they are <e>prone</e>. The defender gets a bonus of +10
                for each leg beyond two that they have (and -10 if they
                have only one leg). Penalties for being lame also apply.
            </para>

            <para>
                If opponents are grappling each other, a trip attempt
                gets a +5 bonus, but the attacker goes down with the
                defender unless a superb success is achieved.

    <advantage name="Throw" type="technique">
        <cost points="2"/>
        <skill name="Brawl"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                A <e>slow</e> attack at -5, success results in a temporary
                hold, as if the defender has been grappled. Immediately
                after success, both attacker and defender make oppossed
                brawl checks, with the defender able to choose between
                using strength or agility. Success for the attacker
                leaves the defender <e>unsteady</e>, whilst a good
                success will leave them <e>prone</e>, and can optionally
                cause stun damage as well - the attacker makes a damage
                roll as normal.
            </para>

            <para>
                An excellent success enables the attacker to place the
                defender wherever they want, within 2m of the attacker.
