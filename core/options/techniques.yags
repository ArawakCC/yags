                is made (with or without weapons), and if successful the
                defender has been grabbed. The defender can choose to
                either grab back, or try to break free. If the latter, an
                immediate oppossed roll is made with

                grapple attempt is broken. On success, both are
                considered to be <e>grappled</e>. Weapons do not count for
                the roll to break free.
            </para>

            <para>
                The reach of this attack is generally zero, so the defender
                may get a <e>free strike</e>. If the attacker has weapons,
                then they count as armed (no automatic strike against them).

    <advantage name="Trip" type="technique">

        <description>
            <para>
                A trip is an attempt to place the defender on the floor by
                throwing or tripping them. A

                roll is made, and on success no damage is done, but the
                defender is considered to be <e>unsteady</e>. A second
                opposed roll is immediately made, with the attacker
                using

                </skillequation>.
                Success by the attacker means that the defender is now
                <e>prone</e>. If the two are already <e>grappled</e>,
                then the first attack roll is not necessary.

    <advantage name="Overrun" type="technique">
        <cost points="0"/>
        <skill name="Brawl"/>

        <description>
            <para>
                An overrun is considered an unarmed attack unless a
                medium or larger shield is being used. The attacker
                makes a
                <skillequation>
                    <attribute>strength</attribute>
                    <skill>brawl</skill>

                roll against the defender's
                <skillequation>

                </skillequation>
                roll to withstand or dodge the attack. On success, the
                attack can move past the defender regardless of any
                attempts by the defender to block the attacker's
                movement. On failure, if the defender resisted with
                strength, then the attacker is stopped from moving any
                further. If agility was used, then the defender side
                stepped and the attacker moved through anyway. However,
                the defender gets an <e>automatic strike</e> against
                the attacker, which may be a <e>trip</e> attack at +10.
            </para>

            <para>
                On a good success by the attacker, stun damage may be
                done to the defender as per a standard brawling attack.
                On an excellent success, the attacker may opt for a
                free <e>trip</e> attack.

                The character is trained in fighting with no weapons against
                armed foes. Doing so is still not suggested, but the

        <description>
            <para>
                A <e>sunder</e> attack is an attempt to break the
                defender's weapon. The attacker makes a dexterity based
                attack roll, and the defender rolls their base
                dexterity x weapon skill. If the attacker succeeds, then
                there is a chance of breaking the weapon. Each extra level
                of success gives the attacker +5 on the following checks.
            </para>

            <para>
                To see if the weapon breaks, the attacker rolls their
                strength x weapon strength (this is the minimum strength
                required to use the weapon) versus the defender's
                strength x weapon strength. The attacker gets +5 if they
                are using a <e>heavy</e> weapon against a <e>light</e>
                weapon, or a metal edged weapon against wood.
            </para>

            <para>
                A <e>good</e> success is needed by the attacker in order
                to <e>weaken</e> the defender's weapon. A weakened weapon
                that is again sundered is broken and cannot be used. A
                weakened weapon will also break if it fumbles an attack
                or defence roll. If the weapon is classed as <e>weak</e>,
                then only a normal success is required. A <e>strong</e>
                weapon needs an <e>excellent</e> success.
            </para>

            <para>
                On a successful sunder, a second check is made immediately,
                and if this also succeeds, then the weapon is broken
                immediately. If the defender has a shield and are using
                the <e>weapon and shield</e> style, or are using two
                weapons with the <e>two weapons</e> style, then the
                defender can choose which weapon is attacked, otherwise
                it is the attacker's choice.

                Change target of attack. When the attack is made, the
                character can instead attack another foe within range.
                This has the advantage that the second target probably
                hasn't declared a defence against the character.
