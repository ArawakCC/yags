                comes into play whenever the character has a penalty to

        <cost points="+6"/>
        <description>
            The character is adept at picking up new languages
            quickly. Any experience placed on language skills
            (excluding the starting score in speak own language) is
            doubled. If <e>literate</e> has been taken, this also
            affects written languages.
        </description>

    <advantage name="Literate" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+4"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character can read and write any languages they can
                speak. The character starts with a scribe score equal to
                the score of each language skill they start with.
                Languages gained during play are not affected.
            </para>

            <para>
                In a campaign where literacy is common, this advantage
                is had by everyone for free, unless <e>illiterate</e>
                is taken.
            </para>

            <para>
                This advantage does not affect languages which have no
                written form, or dead languages which may have no known
                spoken form.

    <advantage name="Bulky" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+5"/>
        <description>
            Built like a barn door, and as tough as a brick, the character
            is capable of shrugging off blows that would knock others down.
            The character must have a strength of at least 4 (and be at
            least average size) for this, but he adds +5 to his knockdown
            score (and rolls to remain standing if that is failed), and
            also gains +5 to soak versus stun attacks.
        </description>

    <advantage name="Ambidexterity" type="advantage">
        <cost points="+2"/>
        <description>

        <description>
            <para>

                and tall. He has a size of six, and has one more body level
                than normal. Such a person must also take a strength of at
                least four.

        <description>
            <para>
                The character is very good at telling if someone is lying.
                They get an automatic +1 to their charisma or perception
                when detecting a lie.

    <advantage name="Albino" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-3"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character is an albino. Skin and hair are white,
                and eyes are pink. They will often suffer sun burn in
                bright sunlight, and suffer double range penalties in
                daylight.
            </para>

            <para>
                An albino may find others reacting badly to him on first
                sight, especially by those who are superstitious or
                paranoid about strangers.
            </para>

        <description>
            <para>
                The character is completely blind. This disadvantage
                cannot be combined with any other that affects sight.

    <advantage name="Combat paralysis" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-4"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character cannot act in the first round of combat, due
                to fear and indecision. If they have surprise, then they
                gain no advantage from the surprise.
            </para>
        </description>

    <advantage name="Illiterate" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-5"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character does not know how to read or write, and
                cannot start with any reading or writing skills in any
                language. This disadvantage can only be taken in a
                campaign where literacy is considered the norm.

    <advantage name="Innumerate" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-5"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character is unable to count above ten, and even that
                requires the use of fingers and thumbs. Arithmetic is very
                difficult, and estimating numbers of things is incredibly
                difficult for groups larger than three.
            </para>

    <advantage name="Loud voice" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-3"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                Character has a very loud voice, and has difficulty
                keeping it down. If trying to speak quietly, they must
                make a will roll of difficulty 20 in order to succeed.

    <advantage name="Noticeable mark" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-1"/>
        <cost points="-3"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character has a strange and obvious mark on their
                body. This is a -1 disadvantage if it isn't normally
                visible, -3 otherwise.
            </para>
        </description>
    </advantage>


    <advantage name="Sexually tantalising" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-3"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                A sexually tantalising person is very attractive to the
                opposite sex. She will often find herself the centre of
                attention, but it is often a shallow, superficial
                form of attention.
            </para>

            <para>
                People will not see beyond the woman's good looks, seeing
                her as a sex object rather than a person. This can sometimes
                be useful, but gets annoying very quickly. Characters must
                have <e>beautiful</e> before taking this disdvantage.

                You need to eat twice as much as everyone else. This
                is not the same as being greedy, since you really do
                need to eat this much to stay alive.
            </para>

    <advantage name="Small" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="-5"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The character is smaller than average, being both shorter
                and thinner. She has a size of four, and therefore has one
                less body level than normal. She cannot have a strength
                above three.
            </para>
        </description>
    </advantage>

    <advantage name="Addiction" type="disadvantage">
        <cost points="varies"/>
        <description>
            <para>
                The addict craves some drug which they need to stave off
                withdrawal symptoms. The cost of the addiction is measured
                by three factors - whether the substance is socially
                accepted (tobacco and alcohol normally are), whether it is
                expensive and/or difficult to get hold of (heroin), and
                whether it has any side effects which affect the character
                in game (alcohol and heroin would, though tobacco wouldn't,
                since the latter's side effects are too long term to have
                any effect in most games).
            </para>

            <para>
                Side effects include anything which can be detrimental to
                the character during the general course of play. An
                alcoholic who drinks himself into a stupor most nights
                may not have much affect on the game. One who is mildly
                drunk all the time will.

                The character looks younger than she really is, possibly
                thirteen or fourteen. As such, adults will not take her
                seriously. A character who looks young cannot take the
                age disadvantage. As the character ages during the game,
                this disadvantage will disappear. The character should
                probably also take <e>Small</e>, and cannot have a

                the smell of blood or the clash of steel. They may be
                skilled at martial arts for sporting events, but when
                it comes to fighting in anger, their nature lets them
                down. In a real combat, they suffer a penalty of -1 to

            <para>
                The character has a poor memory, and probably has a

                manifests itself when trying to remember everyday
                mundane things, such as locking the front door,
                putting out the fire or packing food for a journey.
                At inconvenient moments, the GM will secretly make an
                intelligence check for the character to see if they
                remembered doing something important.

                at the worst possible time. If the player makes any snide
                comments, asides or other such utterences whilst a social
                situation is being roleplayed, then their character said
                it out loud.

            <para>
                The character is particularly gullible. They cannot tell
                if someone is lying, and tend to take things at face
                value. They may well understand the concept of lying, and
                might be very good at it themselves, but can't spot when
                others are doing it.

            <para>
                Normally the character will automatically any attempts to
                detect lying. In really obvious situations, they can have
                a roll but the final result is halved.

            <para>
                The character is particularly clumsy, and has a tendancy
                to bump into things, stumble over their own feet and
                generally lack any grace or finesse of movement. If trying
                to move stealthily, they are doomed to failure.

                If there is anything they can knock, bump or tread on
                which will make a noise then they automatically fail
                at any stealth attempts. In ideal situations, they can
                make a stealth roll but the result is halved.

                The character is very bad at waking from sleep. If they
                are sleeping, then they can only be awakened with lots
                of physical discomfort (cold water, a kick, vigerous
                shaking for a whole round), and are then at -1 to all

                The character really has no sense of direction and can

                of situations (when their rolls are halved), they will
                automatically fail any navigation attempts.
