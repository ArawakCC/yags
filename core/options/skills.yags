            <para>
                This skill covers all forms of athletics, gymnastics and
                acrobatics, including running, jumping and climbing. It is a
                very broad skill, but it is very rare for a character to be
                interested in one facet of it, and not the others.

            <para>
                This skill is used by the character when there is a chance
                of noticing something which isn't obvious, such as someone
                trying to sneak around, people moving at a distance, or
                looking for a secret door. If the character is asleep,
                then any awareness rolls are quartered. If the character
                is only dozing (or day dreaming), then rolls are halved.

                The ability to be friendly and sociable. At its most
                basic, it is a simple charisma skill check since it is not
                normally resisted. The better the roll, the more well
                disposed people will be towards the character.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Charm</e> is charisma based when trying to make

                get them to open up about a subject they would not normally
                want to talk about. All difficulties are modified by
                circumstances (-30 to +30) depending on the initial attitude
                of those being charmed.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Charm</e> can be used to improve a second social skill

                to find out information, flirt or try and talk to someone
                who might be otherwise difficult to talk to (such as a duke
                surround by hangers-on and aids who won't let anyone else
                near him). Generally not resisted.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                <e>Guile</e> allows a character to use and understand
                social methods of deception, through lying, body language
                and actions. A character can lie by making an opposed

                Success means that the target is fooled, though the
                attempt may be modified by circumstances based on how
                probably the lie is.
            </para>

            <para>
                Will is generally used when trying to hide a character's
                own emotions, Charisma to understand another's and
                Intelligence to think quickly when inventing a
                believable story.

                check can often be called for, against the same for the
                target. If the target finds the story plausible, then
                opposed Charisma and will checks may still be necessary in
                order to hide the lie.

            <para>
                This is the ranged attack equivalent of the brawl skill,
                and is used for throwing rocks, spears, knives, axes
                etc at distance targets. The talent is perception based.
                For hurled improvised weapons, short range is considered
                to be four times strength, medium twice this, and long
                range twice medium.
            </para>

            <para>
                This skill can also be used to catch items. When trying
                to catch an item, throw is dexterity based.

                choose a suitable site for battle, to determine weaknesses
                in the enemy's strategy and defences, and to plan the

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                The knowledge of how to use a bow such as a short bow, long
                bow or composite bow. For long bows, for every full four
                points of skill, the effective strength of the character is
                increased by one for purposes of determining the <e>pull</e>
                of the bow that they can draw.

            <para>

                Covers the use of all varieties of hand held crossbows.
                Skill in this provides accuracy, and also enables
                quicker reloading of the heavier versions of the crossbow.
            </para>

            <para>
                The skill can be used with bows, though range penalties
                are doubled, and attacks fumble on a 1-3, due to the
                extra complexity of bows over crossbows.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Covers the use of large two handed weapons such as great
                swords, quarterstaffs and great axes. It generally does
                not cover the use of thrusting weapons such as spears and
                pikes, despite the size of these weapons. When using this
                skill to use a weapon two handed, the effective minimum
                strength of the weapon is reduced by two.
            </para>

            <para>
                If using smaller weapons, attack and defence rolls will
                fumble on a 1-3. If using a shield, it is treated as a
                second weapon (so weapon stats are halved). Any use of
                a second weapon adds a further 2 to the fumble chance.

                There is an area lore skill for each area, normally an area
                the size of a country, with the same culture. An area lore
                skill can give knowledge of surrounding areas, though such
                knowledge will be prejudiced by the beliefs of the original
                area the skill is for.

                Provides care and treatment of wounds to stop bleeding and

                To treat a character's wounds, the base difficulty is 10.
                This is modified upwards by the total of the character's
                stun and wound penalties (a fatally wounded character (-15)
                would be difficulty 25 to treat). Success means that the
                wounds will begin healing naturally. If the roll was made
                by 10 or more, then one level of wound is also healed.

                Stuns are a base difficulty of zero to first aid, again

            <para>
                <e>Foraging</e>: When foraging for food, it takes four hours
                for each roll. Each five over the difficulty allows enough
                food to be found for another two people. If more food is
                found than is needed, then the forager has the option of
                stopping early as soon as enough food has been found. Assume
                that food is found at a consistent rate through the time
                period.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Hunting</e>: Similar to foraging, it takes four hours
                for each attempt to hunt game. Success indicates that
                suitable game has been found, and relevant combat skills
                are required to actually kill the animal. In this case,
                game is large game animals, such as deer.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Navigation</e>: Anyone with any survival skill can
                navigate by use of the sun and stars. This is unaffected
                by the terrain type and difficulty of surviving in that
                terrain. When attempting to navigate, use the character's
                highest survival skill.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Tracking</e>: Survival can be used to track others by
                their footprints and other signs. It is possible to
                estimate the type of animal, their number and how long it
                has been since the tracks were made. Of course, it can be
                used to track people as well.
