    <advantage name="Branded criminal" type="background">
        <cost points="-2"/>
        <cost points="-4"/>
        <description>
            You have been marked as a criminal. -2 point
            disadvantage for petty theft or something similar,
            -5 for something major (maybe dishonour in a society
            which highly values honour) which will cause major
            social problems. The brand is obvious for all to see.
            Note that such a person is not considered an outlaw,
            and to have repaid their debt to society. However, as
            always, people will be prejudiced against the character.

    <advantage name="Dark secret" type="background">
        <cost points="-2"/>
        <cost points="-4"/>
        <description>
            You have a secret in your past which is best left
            hidden. If someone were to find it out, or to make it
            public, your life could become quite complicated. This
            is a -2 disadvantage if the secret would be annoying
            if let out, or -5 if it would be a serious risk to
            your health (you were a member of some particularly
            reviled cult for instance).

    <advantage name="Favours" type="background">
        <cost points="-2"/>
        <description>
            You owe favours to a person, who will call them in at
            some point. Repaying the favours should not be a great
            hardship, but ignoring them will gain you a bad
            reputation (and possibly an enemy).

        <cost points="-1"/>

    <advantage name="Pawn of darkness" type="background">
        <cost points="-4"/>
        <description>
            Either from birth, or because of some event in your
            youth, your life is plagued by the interventions of dark
            powers, be they demons, fey or gods. Alternatively, it
            may have been prophesied that such will come about later
            in your life.
