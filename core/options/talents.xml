    <skill name="Athletics" type="talent">
        <description>
            <para>
                This skill covers all forms of athletics, gymnastics and
                acrobatics, including running, jumping and climbing. It is a
                very broad skill, but it is very rare for a character to be
                interested in one facet of it, and not the others.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Athletic skill checks are normally either instant (jump onto
                a table) or extended (climbing a tree or running some
                distance).
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Sprinting</e>. A character has a base movement (their
                combat move) of agility + strength + 4 metres per round.
                The character can run at double this, or sprint at triple
                this speed. When sprinting the character adds the square
                root of
                <skillequation>
                    <attribute>agility</attribute>

                    <die/>
                </skillequation>
                to their movement.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                <e>Climbing</e>. A climbing character should use the base
                difficulties given below using
                <skillequation>
                    <attribute>agility</attribute>
                    <skill>athletics</skill>
                    <die/>
                </skillequation>
                A failed roll means that the
                character is stuck for that round, unless the roll was
                failed by ten or more, in which case the character will
                slip and fall. For each 10 by which the target is exceeded,
                the distance covered is increased by a multiple (x2, x3 etc),
                up to a maximum of twice the character's combat move (CM).
            </para>

    <!-- Awareness -->
    <skill name="Awareness" type="talent">
        <description>
            <para>
                This skill is used by the character when there is a chance
                of noticing something which isn't obvious, such as someone
                trying to sneak around, people moving at a distance, or
                looking for a secret door. If the character is asleep,
                then any awareness rolls are quartered. If the character
                is only dozing (or day dreaming), then rolls are halved.
            </para>
