        <summary>
            These rules are concerned with the characters and settings
            commonly found in Asian films and history, specifically
            covering Samurai characters and also more modern oriental
            martial arts.

            <para>
                <e>Yags Bushido</e> contains genre specific rules for
                playing characters in feudal Japan or similar settings.
                However, it also includes extended rules for unarmed
                combat skills - commonly known as <e>martial arts</e>
                (though technically, <e>all</e> combat skills, regardless
                of whether they use a weapon or not, are martial arts).
                This makes <e>Yags Bushido</e> also of use to those
                playing in a Western or Modern setting. Because of this
                somewhat wider remit, this article also covers specifically
                Western combat sports such as <e>Boxing</e>.

                <title>The Martial Arts</title>

                <para>
                    By default, <e>Yags</e> uses a single skill
                    (<e>brawl</e>) to cover all unarmed and close weapon
                    combat. Though its name may suggest unskilled drunken
                    bar room fights, a high level of <e>brawl</e>
                    represents a high degree of training and expertise,
                    on par with a 'traditional' martial arts such as
                    Karate.
                </para>

                <para>
                    In a sense, <e>brawl</e> represents no style and no
                    constraints - pretty similar to the style of fighting
                    favoured by Bruce Lee. It's aim is to take down the
                    enemy with a minimum of fuss, and is the skill favoured
                    and tought by modern special forces and police units
                    in the West.
                </para>

                <para>
                    By comparison, the specialist martial arts tend to
                    concentrate on a single style of attack or defence, and
                    though may be better in their given area, are weaker
                    for all round combat. Many of them also teach a
                    philosophy and etiquette (who to bow to, the meaning of
                    the belt colours, who the current masters are) as well
                    as combat skills. Some (such as Judo, or Boxing) are
                    more suited to controlled fights in a sports hall and
                    tend to be very limited on a battlefield.

                <title>Character Generation</title>

                <para>
                    There are no character generation rules specific for
                    <e>Yags Bushido</e>. It is suggested that some form of
                    the Modern rules are used.

                The following <e>traits</e> are suggested for a setting
                where honour and duty are important.

                <para>
                    <e>Honour </e> is about saving face and the
                    reputation of yourself, your Lord and your family.

                <para>
                    Duty is towards your Lord, and commands you to fulfill
                    your responsibilities to the best of your abilities.

                <para>
                    <e>Harmony</e> is sought by priests, who seek to
                    understand the balance of the universe and align
                    themselves towards the Celestial Order. Those who
                    stray from the path, and seek to undo Order are
                    said to be Corrupted.
