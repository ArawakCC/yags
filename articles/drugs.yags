            <para>
                The term drugs is used in Yags to describe any chemical
                substance which is designed to have an affect on a person -
                either detrimental or otherwise. It includes poisons,
                recreational drugs, medicines etc.

                    <para>
                        <e>Generic drugs</e> can have a wide range of
                        effects, and cover all the drugs not covered by
                        the more specific types. A <e>generic</e> will
                        often have several effects which may or may not
                        be resisted by the subject. Poisons are generally
                        generics.

                                The potency of a drug determines how much of it
                                is required to have the listed effect. This is
                                given on a scale from 1 (not very potent) to 6
                                (incredibly potent).

                                Generic drugs can be resisted using the
                                subject's <t>Size</t> x <t>Health</t>. The
                                <e>Strength</e> of the drug is the target
                                number which must be resisted.

                                The period after which a resistance check
                                must be made against the drug. After this
                                check, subsequent checks are made each
                                multiple of this time.

                                A drug with a time of 1 minute, would require
                                a check 1 minute after taking the drug, and
                                each minute thereafter.
