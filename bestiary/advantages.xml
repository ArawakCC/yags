            The creature is able to communicate with people within
            a given range via telepathy. It cannot read anything other
            than their surface thoughts. Communication requires a shared
            language to be used.

            An undead creature is a walking corpse, animated through
            supernatural means. Undead do not need to eat, drink or
            breath. They are difficult to kill, since they do no have
            vital organs. An undead has twice the normal number of wound
            and stun levels. They often have abnormal stamina (nine),
            above average strength, and low will.

            An incorporeal creature has no physical body, and hence no
            direct way to affect the physical world. They have no wound
            or stun levels, and no soak, since they cannot be harmed
            physically. An incorporeal may attack by draining the energy
            from people, causing fatigue levels. When attacking, it only
            requires to touch the individual - a parry is useless. Damage
            uses its will x 4 instead of strength, and the target uses
            their will x 4 for soaking.
