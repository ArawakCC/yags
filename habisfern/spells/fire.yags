                Ignites targeted flamable material. An intense, momentary
                heat is applied to the targets, which has a chance of
                igniting them if they are flammable. For the item affected,
                roll d20 + effect of the spell. If the required target for
                the type of material is achieved, then the item bursts into
                flames.
