            <para>
                Cause the area specified to be covered by a thin film of
                water. The water is obtained from the air, so the amount
                amount gained depends on the humidity. Reduce success by
                one level to three levels for dry air, increase for moist
                air. The air will be dryer after the cantrip has made the
                change.

            <para>
                Creates a mist over an area which obscures vision and
                causes everything to become damp. Once concentration has
                ceased, the mist will dissipate normally. Sound is also
                muffled in the mist, often more effectively than vision.

            <para>
                Causes the specified body of water to radically grow in
                volume. Each 5 points of spell effect will increase the
                volume (and mass) of water by a multiple. The water must
                be in range of the spell when cast, but stays flooded
                even if it passes out of range later.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                If the caster stands in (or near) a stream, then as soon
                as enough water has flowed past to exceed the target of
                the cantrip, further water will not be <e>flooded</e>.

            <para>
                A body of water can be made to such down an object or
                creature within it, or reject that object, enabling it to
                float on the surface. If being forced down, a creature
                can resist with a swim check, failure means that they are
                totally submerged and may begin to drown.

            <para>
                A creature expelled from water may crawl across the surface
                or even attempt to walk, requiring an athletics check to
                remain standing, especially in rough sea.

            <para>
                Control the flow and movement of water within the radius
                of the spell. The effect gives the degree of control.
                Rough sea can be turned to still pond, a river can be
                made to overflow its banks. Once water leaves the spell
                radius, control is lost. However, a wizard standing by
                a river would gain control over water as it flowed into
                range.

                The caster's body changes to a water like substance.
                It can move through water at will, and slowly on

                full strength pretty quickly.
