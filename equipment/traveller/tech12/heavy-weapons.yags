        <description>
            <para>
                Similar to a laser rifle, but powered from an external
                power source. This is usually a power pack strapped to the
                back of the user. It has much better damaging ability,
                range and capacity than its lighter cousins.
            </para>

            <para>
                Such a weapon can be modified to give fully automatic
                ability, but there is a danger of overheating. It is
                possible to plug the rifle into a larger power supply,
                such as one provided by a vehicle.

        <description>
            <para>
                Heavier than a laser rifle, the plasma rifle fires bursts of
                super heated plasma. It tends to have a short range, but is
                capable of considerable damage. It comes with an attached
                power supply which must be worn as a back pack.

        <description>
            <para>
                One of the heaviest man-portable weapons available, it is
                really an anti-armour weapon which also happens to be
                truly nasty against infantry. It is often seen in use by
                <e>battledress</e> troops, since the heavy weight and
                power requirements are best served by powered armour.
            </para>

            <para>
                It's main disadvantage is that the plasma burst is
                sub-sonic, making it possible to avoid beyond short range.

        <description>
            <para>
                This vehicle mounted gauss weapon is designed for use
                against infantry rather than as an anti-armour weapon.
                Per-round, it lacks the stopping power of the chaingun,
                but is more than capable of suppressing and/or killing
                any infantry that come into range.
