            <para>
                This article describes more detailed combat rules, which
                have yet to make it into the main set of rules for combat.
            </para>

            <title>Actions</title>

            <para>
                There are a number of different options a character can
                take when involved in combat. Generally, one option is
                performed each round, and this effects the actions
                performed by the character.
            </para>

            <title>Combat Maneouvres</title>

            <para>
                Each of the different combat skills has a number of skill
                specialisations associated with them, which may be learnt
                in order to perform special combat manouevres above and
                beyond standard actions.
            </para>

            <para>
                Each maneouvre is a skill specialisation, and starts at a
                level of zero. None of the combat skills have a default
                specialisation, so all of them have to be learnt if they
                are to be used.

                        These specialisations are available to all melee
                        fighting styles. Each feat is unique to each style
                        of fighting, so may need to be taken multiple times.

                            and damage, whilst a -5 penalty is suffered on

                            If a person is fighting with a melee weapon in
                            their <e>off-hand</e>, then they need to use
                            this feat. Does not apply to the <e>Brawl</e>

                            If a weapon is not ready at the start of a
                            combat, it may be readied and used to attack in
                            the first round, but the attack is considered
                            <e>slow</e>. If this specialisation is used
                            instead of the main skill, the attack is
                            considered to happen at normal speed.

                            A disarm attack is made against the opponent's
                            weapon, in an attempt to remove it from their
                            hand. An attack is made, and the
                            opponent gets a defence roll at no penalty for
                            the number of defences being made, at a bonus
                            equal to the <e>initiative</e> bonus of the
                            weapon. A successful attack means that the
                            weapon has been disarmed.

                            a light wound, then the defender is killed

                            then the <e>killing blow</e> does nothing

                            An ambush is a surprise attack against a totally

                            i.e. not in combat. A successful ambush attack
                            ignores armour, and counts as a <e>killing
