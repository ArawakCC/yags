<grimoire convocation="Jmorvi">
<prelude>
Jmorvi Shek-Pvar, standing between fire and earth, have an affinity for 
all minerals, but especially metals. Their element is the solid heart of 
the world, steel and black iron. 
Most Jmorvi are artificers; their magic tends to run in a slower vein 
than that of other Shek-Pvar. The element and its manipulators are powerful 
and unyielding, but sometimes brittle, insensitive, brutal and shallow. 
Jmorvi distrust the spiritual believing the soul of humanity to be 
unpredictable and unreliable. They prefer the sureness and solidity of 
cold, hard steel.

<description>
A spell to detect and identify metallic minerals. The caster declares 
a specific metallic mineral and learns the direction to the nearest 
(single) 'good source'. A small amount of refined metal in close 
proximity is more noticeable than a large deposit of ore a hundred 
metres away. Although the spell ignores any Focus through which it 
is cast, it may detect a companion's sword.

<range>Touch</range>

<boost>+10 Soak is tripled</boost>
<boost>+20 Duration Ward</boost>
<description>
An enchantment to temporarily protect a wholly metallic object from 
physical damage. The enchantment lies dormant until it is invoked. 
The Ward is invoked by the first event which could cause damage to 
the object. Once invoked, the enchantment is dispelled (even if the 
duration is concentration). It doubles the soak of the object.

<description>
An enchantment which transforms the surface of a wholly metallic 
object into another metal. The enchantment is fragile, and, because 
it only places an extremely thin veneer, transformed objects will 
not pass more than a cursory inspection. Scratching the object, 
even with a fingernail, removes some of the plating. The 
transformation must be to a lower density metal. The maximum weight 
of the object is 100kg.
