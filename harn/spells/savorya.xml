<grimoire convocation="Savorya">
<prelude>
Savorya is the magic of mind and spirit, perhaps the most esoteric of the
convocations of the Shek-Pvar.
Savoryans deal with aura and knowledge, with principles which, they at least
believe, stand above the other elements, and of the Shek-Pvar. A Savoryan's
is, probably, the greatest knowledge of psionics, and perhaps of Kelestia
itself.
It is not possible to read a person's deep thoughts with Savorya.
The aura of a person can be read. As can their emotions.
The aura of a person consists of (in increasing levels of detail):
	10+	Elemental nature.
	20+	Elemental affiliation (if magic using), or religion if priest.
	30+	Physical/mental wellbeing.
	40+	Law/Chaos.
	50+	Dark/Light.
	60+	Religion (even if not priest).

A person's emotions can be read in the following detail levels:
	10+	Single current active emotion (if any).
	20+	Single current active or passive emotion.
	30+	Target of emotion.
	40+	Conflicting emotions related to main emotion.
	50+	Other emotions currently in force.
	60+ Visual impressions.

<boost>+20 One word answers possible</boost>
<boost>+40 Provides answer to a specific keyword</boost>
<description>
This spell allows the caster to ask a simple yes/no question. The question
must be on a subject close to the caster - it cannot involve knowledge that
cannot be found nearby. The caster can only use this spell, or one similar to
it, once a week. It takes d20*5 minutes before an answer is returned. Higher
castings of this spell provides an answer to a specific keyword or subject.
This gives less control over the answer, but can help if the caster does not
know what question to ask.

<boost>+10 Caster is immune to the glamour</boost>
<boost>+20 Can obscure whol sentances/ideas</boost>
<boost>+40 Can add one new idea to the work</boost>
<description>
An enchantment which can be placed on a written work, or other
information-bearing object, to apparently change its meaning. The
spell does not affect the object, but it adjusts the reader's
understanding. The caster is not immune to the effect.
Whenever someone tries to read the work, they get a will roll
opposed to the caster's own will. The caster does not have to
stay near the work once the spell is cast, but she does have to
concentrate on the spell. Glamour can rarely adjust more than
ten percent of the intrinsic meaning.

<time>8 hours</time>
<range>Touch</range>
<duration>Special</duration>
<boost>+20 Caster can speak/write a translation</boost>
<boost>+40 Neither language nor script needs to be known</boost>
<description>
A spell which allows teh caster to read documents written in a
language or script unknown to her. With the basic spell, the
caster must know either the language or the script.
The spell creates a special relationship between the caster
and a single page of the written work; and cannot be extended
to include other texts or readers. The caster is perceiving
the imprinted thoughts of the author, and this gets harder
with the age of the document. She must make a perception roll
of 15+ if the document is less than a month old, 20+ for up
to a year, and at a further +5 for each tenfold increase in
age of the work. If it was written by someone who didn't
understand what they were writing, translation may be impossible.
The caster cannot speak or write while performing the spell,
so any translations will have to be from memory.

target. The caster declares a specific sense (eyesight, hearing, olfactory or
touch), and thereafter the caster experiences the target's sensations for
that sense. As long as the spell is maintained, the distance between target

<boost>+50 Caster can erase knowledge of his presence</boost>
<boost>+100 Caster may attempt to erase victim's memory in other regards</boost>
<description>
A spell to suppress the will of a victim touched by the caster,
so that she will follow the caster's orders; it is normally used
on animals or people.
Spirit Block creates a bond between caster and his victim. He can
read surface thoughts and emotions, direct her actions and ask
questions. The victim will not volunteer information, so questions
must be very direct and specific. Because of the bond, any harm
which befalls either the caster or the victim is experienced by
the other. So if one is cut, so is the other. If one dies, so
does the other. The victim is aware of the spell, and what was
asked of her.
