<spell name="Chain" level="0" convocation="neutral">
<range>Self</range>
<duration>Special</duration>
<description>
Chain links together multiple other spells, deferring fatigue 
until after all the spells have been cast. No spell in the 
chain can be higher rank than the Chain itself, and at most, 
1 spell per rank of Chain (not including Chain itself) can 
be changed together. All the spells to be cast are declared, 
together with their order, targets etc, and chain is cast. 
If successful, the other spells are each cast. Once the final 
spell is cast, fatigue for all spells (including the chain) is 
then gained. No spell in the chain can have a casting time 
longer than a round, and all must be cast within a round of 
each other.
