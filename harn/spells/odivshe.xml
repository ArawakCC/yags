Odivshe is the magic of slow, cool darkness, of water and ice, the opposite 
of fire and action. Odivshe magi study and work their spells on water and 
shadow, ice and cold. They are sometimes called the wizards of gloom. 
As well as these mundane elements, the Odivshe sometimes manipulate ethereal 
water. This "substance" takes a variety of forms, generally similar to 
ordinary water, but thinner, sometimes invisible. Often it is described as an 
"icy pallor that robs away the breath and drowns the very spirit with its 
dark, clinging, gloom". It takes about twice as long to drown in ethereal 
water, although this may be small comfort to those who have the experience. 
In general, ethereal water is easier to walk/run through than mundane water 
(half air movement rates), and more difficult to swim in (double fatigue). 
The Odivshe use it because it is easier to manipulate than mundane water. 
Ethereal water effects ethereal creatures as mundane water affects mundane 
creatures. It will also quench ethereal fire.

An enchantment which enlarges snowflakes, raindrops, hailstones, 
or other precipitation over a wide area near the caster. Generally, 
the maximum effect is to combine 20 hailstones/raindrops into one.

<spell name="Chalsa's Sponge" level="30" convocation="odivshe">
<range>Reach</range>
<resist>Stamina</resist>
<duration>Concentration</duration>
<description>
An enchantment which causes the target to retain moisture. The 
effect can be unpredictable. In most cases sponge reduces and/or 
prevents thirst, and prevents or inhibits the loss of bodily 
fluids such as sweat, tears and urine. The spell eliminates the 
need for water, but does not affect thirst, so it can be used 
to traverse a desert, but not comfortably. After a few days, 
the target becomes bloated with retained moisture; they are 
generally immobilised after five to seven days, and die in ten.
