<sect1><title>Religion</title>
<para>
The gods of Harn are real, and the powers they grant to their
priests are just as real. Described here are rules for playing
priests in Harn using Yags. For a complete description of the
gods and their beliefs, see the HarnMaster Religion supplement.
</para>

<sect2><title>Cult Invocations</title>

<sect3><title>Levels of Knowledge</title>
<para>
There are three levels of knowledge which define what cult 
nvocations are taught to a trainee priest. Invocations of
level I are taught to all initiates by their mentor. Village
priests will have most, if not all, level I cult invocations,
of some level. In game terms, a priest character can begin
with knowledge of any level I invocation up to the normal
limit of knowledge.
</para>

<para>
Level II invocations are those which are revealed only to those
who have proven themselves to those above them. Often, village
priests will have no knowledge of these, but wandering priests
may perform the services needed from time to time, occasionally
stopping to teach the secrets to those in great need who have
shown diligence in the faith.
</para>

<para>
Knowledge of the Level III invocations is restricted to the
highest levels of the priestly orders, and only those who have
risen in the ranks will be taught them.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Using Cult Invocations</title>
<para>
Cult invocations may be taught to anyone, though only those
favoured by the god may find any use from that knowledge. A 
ult invocation is a mixture of prayer, ceremony and sacrifice
as well as actual skill.
</para>

<para>
The invocation skill is always rolled against charisma. If the
invocation affects another person directly (e.g. It does not
take some physical form), then the target gets a will roll to
resist. Their will is opposed against the priest's will, with 
the priest getting a bonus of one fifth of their invocation roll.
</para>

<sect3><title>Sacrifice</title>
<para>
One of the demands of the skill is that a suitable sacrifice is
made to the god during the prayer ceremony. The nature of the
sacrifice depends on the god, and the ritual that is being used.
It can range from a share of the crops, the loss of a valuable
item, or the sacrifice of an animal, or even a person.
</para>

<para>
The material cost the sacrifice is given with the invocation 
escription, and is rated from low, to very high. This is
relative to the earnings of the person who is benefiting from 
he invocation.
</para>

<para>
If the cost is noted as immediate, then the sacrifice must be
payed before, or as, the invocation is made. Otherwise, it is
possible to delay the sacrifice until afterwards. How long 
afterwards is up to the priest, though as soon as possible is
generally a good idea to avoid invoking the displeasure of
their deity.
</para>

<para>
As a general guide, the following costs of the material
sacrificed can be used.
</para>

<para>
Low: A days earnings.
</para>

<para>
Moderate: A weeks earnings.
</para>

<para>
High: A months earnings.
</para>

<para>
Very high: A years earnings.
</para>

<para>
Some invocations have a spiritual cost as well. This cost is
in luck points, which must be paid immediately. This is shown
as /x after the material cost, where x is the number of luck
points.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Effects of an Invocation</title>
<para>
Invocations are not subtle. If a god is going to be bothered
to interfere amongst mortals, then they want to advertise the
fact. An invocation must clearly name the deity. A successful
invocation will produce obvious special effects. A protected
person might glow, a healing invocation might produce glowing
lights around the person as they are healed. A curse will
strike a person down with flames, darkness or a ray of light, 
epending on the preference of the deity.
</para>

<para>
The effects of Naveh tend to involve darkness, a shimmer
around the object affected or similar illusionary effects.
</para>

<para>
Agrik and Larani tend to be bright, and very obvious. Sarajin's
invocations will tend to summon an icy wind, or a layer of frost.
</para>
</sect3>

<sect3><title>Resisting Invocations</title>
<para>
It is possible to resist the effects of an invocation, though
only if the invocation affects a target directly. An invocation
that causes a pillar of fire to strike a target does not allow 
esistance (other than soak). An invocation which causes disease
in a target does.
</para>

<para>
The resistance is the will of the target against the will of
the priest, with the priest getting a bonus equal to their
invocation skill. Both priest and target also each gain a bonus
equal to their current luck.
</para>

<para>
A resistance roll which fails by 10 or more causes the
invocation to be a critical success, which may have an
additional effect, depending on the invocation.
</para>
</sect3>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Cult Skills</title>
<para>
Cult skills are further secrets of a religion, though unlike
rituals they are totally mundane, but simply not well known.
Most are closely guarded secrets, though some are simply
restricted to a particular religion because no one else has
a need for them.
</para>

<para>
Learning cult skills is restricted, in that anyone with less
than level four in the skill can only improve by having
another teach them. Once level four has been reached,
improvement can be through self study and experience as for
other skills.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Aura</title>
<para>
All living things have an aura, which can sometimes be
determined through religious rituals. The aura of a person
or creature gives an insight into their nature, personality
and religious beliefs.
</para>

<para>
Any religious ritual which allows a priest to divine the
aura of a person uses the following guide for use of their
ritual skill.
</para>
</sect2>

<sect2><title>Priest Characters</title>
<para>
The majority of priests attain priesthood after spending
many years training in a religious institution. There, they
are taught the tenants of their faith, as well as the basic
invocations and cult skills they are expected to learn.
</para>

<para>
Player character priests will normally be at least 21 years
old. Characters younger than this will rarely have had time
to learn all the necessary skills, and will be considered an
acolyte, rather than a full priest.
</para>

<para>
Priests of all religions will have the following common
invocations:
</para>

<para>
Blessing 2
</para>

<para>
They will also have the following skills:
    Religion (their own) 4
    Scribe (their own) 4
</para>

<para>
These do need to be paid for.
</para>
</sect2>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Common Invocations</title>
<para>
Common invocations are available to, and taught by, priests
of all religions. However, they are different in the details,
so the invocation skill for Blessing (Morgath) is very different
to that for Blessing (Larani).
</para>

<para>
Many of the common invocations are based off the same invocation
skill. There are three meta-invocations - Blessing, Channel and
Divination. All priests start with at least knowledge of
Blessing. This provides knowledge of the basic ceremonies the
priest has to be able to perform, in order to contact their god,
perform baptism's, marriage and funeral rites.
</para>

<para>
Invocations which make use of these meta-invocations will name
them in parenthesis after the invocation title.

<description>
The priest leads a group of people in prayer and ceremony
in order to petition their god. Only those who are of the
same (or a closely allied) faith can gain from this ritual,
and each person can only benefit once a week. The cost must 
be paid by everyone present, in the form of a collection.
Those who don't donate to the church, don't get any benefit.
At the end of the ritual, all those present gain one point
of luck, up to a maximum based on the number of people
present, and the skill of the priest in petitioning the god.

Silken Voice (Halea)
The only clerical order of the Church of Halea. It is a female order noted for its comely members. The mother house of the order deals with the sale and #rental# of pleasure slaves, highly trained in the erotic arts. The trade in slaves is a significant source of revenue for Halea's church.
Members of the Silken Voice are considered acolytes until age 21. There are two paths a priestess can follow, either concentrating on the giving of pleasure, or to take an interest in financial matters. Eventually, most will take the second path as they become too old for the former.
Particularly attractive acolytes will begin training in the erotic/entertainment arts from 12 or 13.

Larani
Lady of Paladins
The Lady of Paladins is the goddess of chivalry and battle, favoured by the feudal nobility. Those who follow her are expected to display courage, compassion and honour.
Despite being a goddess of War, Larani despises violence, and believes that it should only be used as a last resort. Her followers vary greatly in how closely they follow this particular ideal, the militant orders of her church can be especially lax at times at avoiding violent confrontation.
There are two clerical orders - The Spear of Shattered Sorrow and the Order of Hyvrik. Both have martial and non-martial members, though all (in theory) prefer non-violent solutions to disputes.
The sponsored fighting orders are not taught priestly invocations, unless they have proven themselves worthy over a long period of time.

Morgath
Tormentor of the Unlamented Dead
Morgath is the master of chaos, evil and the undead, who despises all things fair and noble. His church is dour and ruthless, and infamous for its human sacrifice.
The most feared aspect of priests of Morgath is their ability to create, and control, undead. There are two types of undead # the Amorvrin (willing) and the Gulmorvrin (unwilling). The latter are far more common.
Encounters with the Shadow
Amorvrin may have a shadow extending beyond their bodies. Entering this, or touching a morvrus, is generally not a good idea. It is an extension of Bukrai # the power of Morgath.
Contact with the Shadow causes an immediate mental attack on the living soul. The morvrus attacks with its will, as per a damage roll which is soaked with the living soul's own will. Damage is suffered in fatigue levels. Each round of contact causes another will attack.
Note that for a gulmorvrin, touch is enough to initiate this will attack, even if the attack does not get through armour.
If the living creature falls unconscious from fatigue, then they are possessed by the Shadow. The soul is offered two choices # accept it, and become an amorvrus, or refuse it and become gulmorvrus.
In any event, the living creature immediately becomes undead. Their body levels are effectively doubled, and if they are gulmorvrin, they come under the control of the Shadow which possessed them.
The Shadow extends out one metre for each point of will an amorvrin has. If multiple Shadows are overlapping, only one Shadow attack is made, but at increased strength. Use the highest will # 4, plus 1 for each point of will overlapping.
Cult Invocations
Speak with Dead I
Time: 15 minutes        Range: Self
Difficulty: 10
Allows conversation with a captured soul. The soul may initiate mental conflict. A soul may be captured during a ceremony in which the body is sacrified to Morgath. Alternatively, any gulmorvrus can be questioned in this way.
Heart of Darkness I
Time: 15 minutes        Range: Touch
Difficulty: 10        Cost: Low
The cleric channels a small portion of the Shadow of Bukrai into a person. It is treated as a will attack as per entering the Shadow of Bukrai. If this ritual is performed on a dead corpse, it immediately bcomes a gulmorvrus, with a will of one. The Difficulty is 10 if the corpse has been dead less than a day, 20 if less than a week, 30 if less than a month, 40 if less than a year, and 50 if year+.
Necrosy I
Time: 15 minutes        Range: Touch

Allows the priest, or the subject touch, to find and enter a Shadow of Bukrai safely. While within the Shadow, the subject will appear slightly translucent # bones and internal organs will be visible if not covered by clothing. This invocation is used to allow living followers attending ceremonies with Amorvrin.
Eyes of Klyss II
Time: 1 round        Range: Touch
Difficulty: 10        Cost: Low
