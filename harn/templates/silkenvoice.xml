	<description>
	The only clerical order of the Church of Halea. It is a female
	order noted for its comely members. The mother house of the
	order deals with the sale and #rental# of pleasure slaves,
	highly trained in the erotic arts. The trade in slaves is a
	significant source of revenue for Halea's church.
	Members of the Silken Voice are considered acolytes until age
	21. There are two paths a priestess can follow, either
	concentrating on the giving of pleasure, or to take an interest
	in financial matters. Eventually, most will take the second path
	as they become too old for the former.
	Particularly attractive acolytes will begin training in the
	erotic/entertainment arts from 12 or 13.
