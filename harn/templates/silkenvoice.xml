<character-template name="Silken Voice">
<description>
The only clerical order of the Church of Halea. It is a female order noted for its comely members. The mother house of the order deals with the sale and #rental# of pleasure slaves, highly trained in the erotic arts. The trade in slaves is a significant source of revenue for Halea's church.
Members of the Silken Voice are considered acolytes until age 21. There are two paths a priestess can follow, either concentrating on the giving of pleasure, or to take an interest in financial matters. Eventually, most will take the second path as they become too old for the former.
Particularly attractive acolytes will begin training in the erotic/entertainment arts from 12 or 13.
