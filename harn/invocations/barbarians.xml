	<description>
		Allows adherents of the same deity to voluntarily transfer
		luck from themselves to the shaman. The luck can be used
		to replace luck which has been spent temporarily, and
		cannot take the shaman to above their normal limit. If
		the luck is not used by the time the shaman next prays to
		their god, then it is lost.
		<br/>
		One point of luck may be taken from all those who touch
		the shaman at the time the invocation is invoked.
