                This is the skill of fighting with a heavy or bladed
                weapon. You are not specialised in any particular style
                of fighting, but you have a good knowledge of how to
                attack and defend.

            <para>
                You are skilled in firing pistols and similar small hand
                guns, including revolvers, automatic pistols and SMGs.
                This skill is most effective at short ranges and when in
                close combat with the target. It is always based on
                <t>Dexterity</t>.

            <para>
                At short range, you may normally add the attack bonus of
                the weapon to your attack roll unless you are making a

                The use and handling of rifles, carbines, shotguns
                and the like. It is not very effective at very close range,
                but is designed for short to medium ranges. Can be used
                with either <t>Dexterity</t> or <t>Perception</t>.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                A style of unarmed combat which concentrates on throws and
                locks. It is designed for real combat, and has a number of
                techniques to get your opponent into a position ready to
                be thrown or grabbed.
            </para>

            <para>
                You gain a +1 to your agility for all trip attacks and
                defences, and always use <y:agility>Aikijutsu</y:agility>
                for such manoeuvres. If fighting from the prone position,
                you suffer no penalties. It can otherwise be used in place
                of <e>Brawl</e> for punches, kicks, dodges and other
                unarmed combat moves.
            </para>

            <para>
                If using a weapon, you gain the damage bonus of the weapon
                and suffer a +1 increase in the fumble chance.

        <short>An aggressive unarmed combat style.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                <e>Karate</e> is one of the most popular (or at least, well
                known) styles of unarmed combat in the modern world. It
                is specialised in attack rather than defence. Though it
                is often used as a sport, it is effective in a real fight
                as well.
            </para>

            <para>
                It is used in the same way as <e>brawl</e> in combat,
                though it does not teach the use of weapons. When fighting
                unarmed, you gain a bonus to damage equal to your skill,
                but suffer a -1 penalty to agility for defence rolls.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                A particular style of unarmed combat that is designed for
                use in real combat situations. It is specialised in making
                throws and trips, but unlike <e>Judo</e> is also effective
                in attack.
            </para>

            <para>
                Jujutsu may be used in place of <e>Brawl</e> for all
                unarmed combat manoeuvres. When making <t>strength</t>
                checks for grapple and trip <e>attacks</e>, you may use
                <t>agility</t> instead, and also gain a +1 bonus to
                either attribute in each case.
            </para>

            <para>
                Use of a weapon with this skill gives you the damage bonus
                of the weapon, but not the attack or defence bonuses unless
                it is a brawling or longshaft weapon.

                This weapon skill was developed in Okinawa, and favours

                and the sai - basically weapons adapted from peasant tools.

                This skill provides you with knowledge of how to use
                heavy weapons such as vehicle mounted machine guns,
                grenade launchers, anti-tank weapons and mortars.
                Most non-man portable weapons fall into this
                category. Always uses <t>Perception</t> when
