            <para>
                This is a broad skill covering all forms of athletics,
                gymnastics, acrobatics and swimming.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Running">
            <para>
                Running represents a light jog which you can keep up for
                many minutes without too much difficulty. When running,
                you move a number of metres each round equal to your
                <t>move</t> score. A point of fatigue is gained every
                <y:health>athletics</y:health> minutes you are running.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Sprinting">
            <para>
                Sprinting represents an all out sprint, moving as quickly
                as you can. You cannot do anything else whilst sprinting,
                and most people can only sprint for a few rounds before
                becoming exhausted.
            </para>

            <para>
                When sprinting, you may move a distance in metres equal to
                <t>move</t> x 2 + <e>athletics</e> each round, and gain a
                point of fatigue each round.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                This skill is used by the character when there is a chance
                of noticing something which isn't obvious, such as someone
                trying to sneak around, people moving at a distance, or
                looking for a secret door. If the character is asleep,
                then any awareness rolls are quartered. If the character
                is only dozing (or day dreaming), then rolls are halved.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                A general purpose combat skill covering dodging, punching
                and wrestling. This is covered in more detail in the combat
                section. It allows the use of small weapons such as knives
                and daggers, as well as improvised weapons such as stones,
                bottles, sticks and chairs.
            </para>

            <para>
                A character may always use the <e>brawl</e> skill to dodge
                even if they are using a weapon, but they don't get any
                bonuses from the weapon if they do so.

        <short>Being nice to people.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                A high <e>charm</e> allows you to appear friendly and
                sociable. It is nearly always based on <t>empathy</t>,
                and allows you to make a good impression and gain people's
                interest and trust.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Charm</e> can be used to improve a second social skill
                test (such as <e>guile</e>, <e>trade</e> or
                <e>perform</e>). Make a <empathy>charm</empathy> check
                against the <will/> of the target to gain a +3 bonus for

            <para>
                Used at parties and similar social gatherings. Can be used
                to find out information, flirt or try and talk to someone
                who might be otherwise difficult to talk to (such as a duke
                surround by hangers-on and aids who won't let anyone else
                near him). Generally not resisted.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml" task="Chatter">
            <para>
                Mindless chatter to try and draw information out of
                someone, or to simply distract them. Generally not
                resisted, unless the target is being deliberately close
                mouthed about a subject.

        <short>Using and recognising deceit.</short>

            <para>
                <e>Guile</e> allows a character to use and understand
                social methods of deception, through lying, body language
                and actions. A character can lie by making an opposed
                <y:will>guile</y:will> against the target's
                <y:empathy>guile</y:empathy>. Success means that the target
                is fooled, though the attempt may be modified by
                circumstances based on how probably the lie is.
            </para>

            <para>
                Will is generally used when trying to hide a character's
                own emotions, <t>empathy</t> to understand another's and
                <t>intelligence</t> to think quickly when inventing a

                <y:intelligence>guile</y:intelligence>
                check can often be called for, against the same for the
                target. If the target finds the story plausible, then
                opposed <t>empathy</t> and will checks may still be
                necessary in order to hide the lie.

                Sleight of hand, from filching items on a market stall,

            <para>
                This is the ranged attack equivalent of the brawl skill,

                etc at distance targets. The talent is dexterity based.
                For hurled improvised weapons, short range is considered
                to be four times strength, medium twice this, and long
                range twice medium.

            <para>
                This skill can also be used to catch items. When trying
