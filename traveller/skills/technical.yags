            <para>
                Plotting a course through jump space is a difficult
                process, and getting it wrong can result in a very messy
                death. How good you are determines how long it takes. The
                examples given below assume access to a basic computer,
                and you only want to make a one parsec jump. Add +5 to the
                difficulty for each extra parsec jumped.

                The skill of being able to pilot a small space craft, such
                as a shuttle, fighter or cargo pod. Anything much larger
                doesn't require <e>piloting</e> as such, and uses the
                <e>Orbital navigation</e> or <e>Spaceship systems</e>
                skills instead.

                If you want to perform some clever manouevre making use
                of gravity sling shots you need <e>Orbital navigation</e>.
                This skill very much concentrates on the point-and-thrust

            <para>
                Knowledge of how to fly and operate a spaceship. This is
                the skill needed by all bridge crew, and at least some
                of the engineering crew as well. It covers the most
                common protocols and etiquette involved in flying a
                spaceship in an inhabited system, how to access ship
                systems, how to provide the navigation computers with
                instructions and so on.

                the entire enterprise of conducting a battle completely
                different from more mundane surface events. This skill
                provides knowledge of how to judge distances and speeds,
                the type of weapons deployed in most space battles, and
                how to make best use of offensive and defensive systems.

            <para>
                You are experienced in the use of computer and electronic
                devices including but not limited to computers, communication
                systems and sensor systems. Normally it is used for writing
                documents, searching for information, or monitoring displays.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                A hacker is someone who has in depth knowledge of how
                computer systems work. Sometimes, this knowledge can be
                put towards circumventing security on computer systems,
                but doesn't have to. This skill covers programming,
                system design, network administration and most other
                advanced tasks.
            </para>

            <para>
                The point-and-click style of system administration can
                be covered by <e>Computer operation</e>, though this skill
                doesn't include much knowledge of why things work the

                You have been trained in the use of both communications and

                a radar display, but you have indepth knowledge of how such
                things actually work, and how best to interpret data from
                them. You have been trained in the use of electronic warfare,
                how to get the best range out of communications gear, how
                to interpret poor quality signals, and how to make best

                pads, electronic locks, iris and fingerprint scanners
                etc. It can be used to forge ID to try and bypass such
                systems.

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                This is a broad skill which covers both fixing machines
                and fixing electronics. You have some knowledge of the
                tasks required to fix cars, boats, planes, tanks,
                spacecraft and computers. Since this is a very broad skill,
                specialisations may be bought as techniques.
            </para>

            <para>
                The base skill allows you to fix and repair things as long
                as spare parts are readily available. If no spares can be
                obtained, then difficulties are doubled in order to jury
                rig a fix unless you also know a suitable technique.
                Normally, fixing an item will require a diagnosis check
                to figure out what is wrong (which may only take a few
                minutes) followed by a repair check to actually fix it
                (which may take many hours). Checks are based on
                <t>Intelligence</t>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Knowledge of a technique also halves penalties for complex
                fixes, lack of proper tools, or needing to fix something
                quickly.
