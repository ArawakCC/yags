                Tactics, strategy and leadership when planning and fighting
                a battle involving small groups. It can be used to
                choose a suitable site for battle, to determine weaknesses
                in the enemy's strategy and defences, and to plan the
                logistics of travel and supply.

            <para>
                Unlike <e>Tactics</e>, which is concerned with small scale
                skirmishes, military strategy provides knowledge and
                experience of running a war, including making most
                effective use of troops, logistics and knowledge of
                large scale tactics.

        <short>Blowing things up efficiently.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Blowing things up is easy, but doing it with the minimum
                of explosives, at minimal risk to yourself, and in a way
                that causes maximum damage is somewhat harder. This skill
                provides everything you need to know about destroying
                things with explosives. You also know about the different
                types of explosives, how best to store, move and deploy
                them, and how to disarm other people's bombs.

    <skill name="Combat engineering" type="skill">
        <group>Military</group>

        <short>Building things quickly.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Most infantry has experience with digging trenches,
                building bridges and putting up sandbags. A combat
                engineer has a lot of experience doing this. This
                skill covers getting the job done in the minimum
                time, often so that's its good enough to do what it
                needs to do. It covers a wide range of tasks, from
                bridge building to tunneling, and is more practical
                than theoretical.
            </para>

            <para>
                Unlike 'real' engineering skills, this one assumes
                that the needed materials aren't readily to hand and
                that the people doing most of the heavy lifting are
                are mostly unskilled infantry, so the result will
                often be simple and ugly. But it'll work.

        <short>Safely using orbital re-entry vehicles.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                You have been trained to use personal re-entry sleds which
                allow you to safely land on the ground from orbit. They
                are heavily heat shielded, and can cope with hypersonic
                velocities during rentry. They are used both for military
                assualts and as an (expensive) extreme sport.

        <short>Protecting your mind from psionic attack.</short>

        <description xmlns="http://yagsbook.sourceforge.net/xml">
            <para>
                Though Psionics is outlawed in the Imperium, law enforcement
                and military agencies sometimes have to go up against those
                who are trained in its use. The military will sometimes give
                training to its special forces to protect from mental assualt
                and mind reading.
            </para>

            <para>
                <e>Psionic Block</e> does not require any actual psionic
                ability, but by concentrating on repetitive words and
                phrases the trained individual can prevent others from
                reading their mind. Normally this precludes any other
                actions, and all skill checks are at -40 whilst attempting
                this. It is very obvious to anyone looking at you that you
                are concentrating hard on something.
