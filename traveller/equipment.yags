                is given here.

                <para>
                    The following weapons are available in the Imperium. Slug throwers
                    still make for good, general purpose, weapons and are the least
                    likely to break when put through the sort of abuse most equipment
                    sees in the battlefield.

                            Firearm. Missile weapon firing a high velocity round.
                            Halves all armour which isn't rated as bullet proof.
                            Quarters most defence rolls (except full defence).
                        </item>

                        <item name="Au">
                            Fully automatic weapon, capable of firing multiple
                            shots or burst fire.
                        </item>

                        <item name="SA">
                            Semi-automatic weapon, can fire multiple shots in a
                            single round but is not capable of burst fire.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Li">
                            Light weapon. Double the value of heavy or
                            bulletproof armour (overrides the effects of
                            being a firearm).
                        </item>

                        <item name="Hv">
                            Heavy weapon. Halves non-heavy bulletproof armour,
                            ignores all weaker types of armour.
                        </item>

                        <item name="TA">
                            Automatic weapon that can fire automatic bursts of
                            3 rounds as a single attack. Counts as a single
                            attack, but any wounds caused are doubled.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Ls">
                            Laser weapon, unaffected by wind, though may suffer
                            in fog and thick atmospheres. Does not loose accuracy
                            or suffer fumble increase at medium and long range.
                            Counts as a firearm for defence rolls.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Pl">
                            Plasma weapon. Often does explosive damage. Does not
                            count as a firearm for purposes of defence and armour
                            (so only halves defence rolls).
                        </item>

                        <item name="Ex-X">
                            Explosive damage. Does full damage to the target and
                            those within X metres. Does mixed damage at -5 out to
                            double X, and stun damage at -10 out to triple X.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Lo-X">
                            Weapon must be reloaded. X is number of rounds to reload.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Vc">
                            Vehicle weapon. Against non-vehicle targets, completely
                            ignores all soak unless heavy armour is worn, in which
                            case the soak roll is merely halved.

                    <para>
                        These are small weapons designed to be easily man
                        portable. They range from pistols up to rifles.

                    <para>
                        These weapons are either normally vehicle mounted,
                        or considered to be squad support weapons, often used
                        by troops in full battledress. At the very least they
                        require backpacks for energy or ammunition.

                        Mostly anachronistic, melee weapons are still used in
                        some circumstances, often for stylistic reasons. The
                        weapons listed here are the Tech Level 12 equivalents
                        of ancient weapons.
