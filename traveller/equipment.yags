                    The following weapons are available in the Imperium. Slug throwers
                    still make for good, general purpose, weapons and are the least
                    likely to break when put through the sort of abuse most equipment
                    sees in the battlefield.

                            Halves all armour which isn't rated as bullet proof.
                            Quarters most defence rolls (except full defence).

                            Fully automatic weapon, capable of firing multiple
                            shots or burst fire.
                        </item>

                        <item name="SA">
                            Semi-automatic weapon, can fire multiple shots in a
                            single round but is not capable of burst fire.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Li">
                            Light weapon. Double the value of heavy or
                            bulletproof armour (overrides the effects of
                            being a firearm).
                        </item>

                        <item name="Hv">
                            Heavy weapon. Halves non-heavy bulletproof armour,
                            ignores all weaker types of armour.
                        </item>

                        <item name="TA">
                            Automatic weapon that can fire automatic bursts of
                            3 rounds as a single attack. Counts as a single
                            attack, but any wounds caused are doubled.

                        <item name="Ls">
                            Laser weapon, unaffected by wind, though may suffer
                            in fog and thick atmospheres. Does not loose accuracy
                            or suffer fumble increase at medium and long range.
                            Counts as a firearm for defence rolls.
                        </item>

                        <item name="Pl">
                            Plasma weapon. Often does explosive damage. Does not
                            count as a firearm for purposes of defence and armour
                            (so only halves defence rolls).
                        </item>

                            those within X metres. Does mixed damage at -5 out to
                            double X, and stun damage at -10 out to triple X.

                            Weapon must be reloaded. X is number of rounds to reload.

                        <item name="Vc">
                            Vehicle weapon. Against non-vehicle targets, completely
                            ignores all soak unless heavy armour is worn, in which
                            case the soak roll is merely halved.

                    <title>Pistols</title>

                    <para>
                        Pistols covers all short barreled weapons designed
                        to be used with a single hand. They are generally
                        suffer from a shorter range and poorer accuracy than
                        rifles, but have the advantage of being much easier
                        to carry.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Most are cheap and easy to obtain, and are often made
                        from tough plastics. All use the <e>Pistol</e> skill.
                    </para>

                    <title>Rifles</title>

                    <para>
                        Designed for hunting or combat. Pretty obvious to
                        carry around, but have better range and accuracy
                        than pistols. All use the <e>Rifle</e> skill.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        The rifles here are all of the slugthrower type.

                    <title>Energy Weapons</title>

                    <para>
                        Lasers are excellent as sniping weapons, though power limitations
                        can be their downfall, and fully automatic lasers aren't man
                        portable. Lasers which don't have an external power pack suffer
                        from range limitations, especially within an atmosphere.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        Plasma weapons pack a heavy punch, but are short range. The plasma
                        bolt tends to loose heat rapidly in an atmosphere but are good at
                        getting through powered armour. As for lasers, they often require
                        an external power pack and tend to lack full auto capability.
                    </para>

                    <para>
                        These weapons are normally vehicle mounted, and not
                        designed to be used by infantry except from fixed
                        emplacements.

                    <para>
                        Mostly anachronistic, melee weapons are still used in
                        some circumstances, often for stylistic reasons. The
                        weapons listed here are the Tech Level 12 equivalents
                        of ancient weapons.

                <para>
                    The following types of armour are commonly available.
                    Low-tech worlds will of course have plenty of low tech
                    armour available, but this is of limited use against
                    firearms.
